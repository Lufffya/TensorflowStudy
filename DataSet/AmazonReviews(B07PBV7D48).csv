Love the colors and the product
Super easy to install
My wife has long thick hair that always clogs the shower drain
She bought these and they work
Worth it
Less hair down the drain
Works perfectly and looks good
"Does a great job at blocking anything going down the drain, the only drawback is that with our particular tub it blocks the water itself just enough to make a slippery area"
Love it and the selection of colors
It Took seconds to install and so easy to clean
Used this for our shower stall
Fits perfect over our drain which is about 3-4inches in diameter
Doesn't float away during use of shower
Neutral colors so it goes well with our bathroom
Would recommend buying
These catch very little hair
They were  a waste of money for me
I went back to $1
99 version you can buy in any hardware store or Wal-Mart
I loved this product it worked great
Definitely recommend
No suction at all
Really didn't do the job because the catcher didn't stay in place
Easy to install and remove
The size is about an adult's palm size round shape so pretty much covers most of our sink holes
Cathes hair easily but needs little extra work to remove hair
"Overall, it's great product"
"Colors are cute, only used it once but looks promising"
It kept moving around tho and didn't stay on the drain
"Great Product, easy to use and clean"
"The drain covers come in cool colors and work very well in the tub, shower, or sink"
Didn't work for my drain
These drain covers give me peace of mind that the drain will not clog
"After several uses, I am a satisfied customer"
Great that the package comes with several colors to pick from and has so many covers for a great price
Would recommend to a friend and buy again myself if needed
These are nice
Comes with 5 colors fits well over the drain area to catch items
Easy to clean out
They suction down to stay in place
Would certainly recommend and order agai
"No suction at all, it grabs some of my hair but  can still slip through even if I empty it every shower"
These hair stoppers absolutely do not work
"They sit too high for a flat shower drain, so don't stay put and are not effective"
"They sit too low for a traditional tub drain, so they don't cover it correctly"
I was disappointed
just another $10
00 wasted
good size and sticks well to the tub
"design and colors are cute, so that's a plus"
Catches hair well
This was basically exactly what I was looking for
"Although it was too big, after easily cutting the outer most 'ring' off, it fit perfectly"
Easy to clean and flexible
cute colors
works well
Easy to Install
"It works, just not really sure it catches all the hair"
Good product
But has a weird smell
These are super handy and a great price
I shed so much hair while showering so a hair catcher is a must
These are large enough to cover most size drains and suction to the tub very easily
Very happy with this purchase
Helps at any location
Seems to a bit too big for my bathroom sinks and slides around with the drain stop in my shower but seems to catch hair though
My hair is so long
This product works really great in my shower
It stays put and it collects a lot of my hair
Not much to say other than it works exactly as described and I'm happy with this purchase
I've had metal ones in the past but prefer silicon because it retains its shape whereas my old one would bend and then not sit flush
I have 2 daughters with long hair and these catch it so I dont have to clear the drains as often
"Functions as expected, and you can even cut them down for smaller drains"
The material is quality
"Easy to install, just lay in tub and that is it"
Received the order on time and quickly
"Like the colors, works very well in our shower"
Had to remove the plug to install
Very satisfied with the purchase
I saw some reviews and was worried but for the price I thought I would try them
I am very happy
"They look better than that drain, they have assorted colors and they are easy to clean"
They do the job and look good
"This is solid and sturdy, comes in nice colors too"
I think this is good value for money
Seems durable
Works great
Haven't had any clog upset so far
This works very well in my bathroom
"I share a bathroom with two other girls and we all have long hair, and now we almost never have to clean out our drain"
We just clean it after every time we shower which is way easier to do than fish hair out of a drain
Works as described
Does move around in my shower a bit
Also does cause the water to fill slightly in the shower base compared to having just the normal drain cover
"But in all, it drains quickly once shower is off"
"Note, we do not have a low flow shower head"
Beautiful colors
Love that there are 5
Great price and they fit wonderfully
The product does the job and is affordable
A must have for your house
Works great
Catches hair and does the job
I have a shower with a flat drain and this fits nicely over
Great price for a pack of 5
It is easy to clean as it just lays over the top of the drain so it is easy to take in and out of the shower
"Easy to install, easy to use and easy to clean"
works great for the bathtub
once installed had way less issues with hair collecting and interrupting the flow of the drain
would recommend and purchase again
So far I have added one to every single sink or shower in my house
"This product is amazing, especially in the kitchen"
I was having trouble finding a product that would what this one does and this one is absolutely perfect
Definitely money spent well
"Did not stay over the sink drain, debris just went under it"
stayed better in the shower but I'm not sure how much hair it caught and how much went down the drain
Good buy
I own a few rental properties and have decided to start providing drain covers to catch hair in all of the bathtubs
"The ones at the big box stores cost $6 to $10 individually, so I found this on my colored pack on Amazon with five year catchers for the price it would normally cost me to purchase one in a store"
Great investment that will save my calls for the plumber
"The product was easy to put on, you just place it over the drain, but when you take a shower, it stops the water from flowing through until it's high enough to pass through the ridges"
"When you wash your hair, the hair spins around the outside and sometimes swirling into the middle"
"Basically you're standing in water with hair swirling all over the place and when you're done your shower, the hair is NOT easily removed"
You have to pick up the stopper and UNTANGLE all of your hair
I thought the hair would be easier to remove
I would not recommend this product
Not completely air tight
Hair still gets underneath and in the drain
it works well
catches hair in shower and food waste in the kitchen sink
"My boyfriends hair falls out like crazy, and both of us were tired of buying products to unclog the drain"
"Found these on amazon, and so far it has been a major lifesaver as well as a money saver"
Highly recommend
This product gets the job done and very good value for the price
Only complain is it floats when there is more water and slips little bit
My hair is super thick and long
This catcher works awesome
No more pouring Drano
Not too thrilled with the product but then again it is just a dull hair catcher item for your bathroom
Has no suction to stay in one place
Just sits on the shower stall drain and even floats if water gathers around it
Colors are are depicted but on the dull sideI got the feeling that this is a dollar store item and here I paid twice as much as the price is $9
99 for 4 of them
I will keep 'em as I don't like returning low priced items
Great and easy product for the shower
Very simple to clean as well
You get a pack of 5 for $10
It's a great deal
it gets the job done what else can I say
Great to keep hair out of bathtub
Exactly what I wanted and needed
Plus they are attractive and easy to clean
Works well
Very light weights and easy to remove
Love the color choices
Found so many uses for it all over the house that I didn't realize I needed
Still new user for this product but looks very promising for its purpose
Love the colors
Does a great job
I really enjoy this product
Its affordable and I like that you get some many catchers
"As a woman with natural hair and multiple bathrooms in my house, I love the I don't have to travel with one catcher if I decided to wash my hair in a different bathroom and or sink"
I also live the fact that it fits my bathroom drain
"In the past, I've had a hard time finding one that is universal enough to fit the different types of drains in my house"
"And most importantly, lets just say my husband also loves the product as he does not have to snake our drains as often as he had to before"
"This product is great for our shower, we've been having problems with hair clogging the drain and decided to purchase this product"
It was a great deal for this 5 pack because now we can replace if needed and we also have extra to use in our kitchen sink making it easier to do dishes and not have to worry about food getting clogged in the drain
If only my tub didn't have the drain stopper where I am unable to take it out this would be perfect for catching all my hair
Unfortunately it does so when I try to place this on top it doesn't sit properly and the hair goes underneath that being said this would work perfectly for a standing shower where it can sit on suction
It comes in a lovely set with multiple to cover many showers
This did not work at all as a hair catcher
I used it most of a week without catching anything
It floats up when water moves and I got it to use in the shower
I found it to be totally useless
"I went back to the old discolored and stiff with age one I had, and ordered something similar to that"
These are great for catching long hair before it hits the drain
Super wonderful product
Being a person whose hair seems to shed like a golden retriever this product is a life saver
I do highly suggest cleaning it every other shower so that it doesn't get so overly gross
Well worth the purchase
A lot bigger than I thought it would be but that just means it covers the drain a lot easier
I hate touching wet hair and this makes it so I don't have to while also saving my drains
I also love the colors
"There is absolutely no suction, hence no hair gets trapped"
It slides all over
"They are WAYYY too big for a bathtub unless your drain is a massively wide, use it for like a kitchen sink or something if you decide to keep it"
When I put one of them on my tub it was too big and water couldn't even go down the drain
This product is such a great buy
The quality is good and fits on every drain
I have kinky curly hair
"It tangles all over the place, but could not tangle on this thing"
It catches probably 10% of the hair that falls
I'm still having to pull hair out the drain
"It was easy to install, but I just got it"
Hope it works well seems easy to clean will update if I run into any problems
Right now looks good
Good quality for price
works good and is cheaper than others
Easy to use and helps your drains plus they're in cute colors
I was shopping around for a while ' hesitant about buying the usual metal stopper since they tend to get moldy over time
Glad I found this silicone option
"Very easy to clean, cute design, stays in place, and most importantly'stops all my dark chunks of hair from clogging our shower drain"
Great price for a pack of 5 too
This drain cover effectively catches hair before it goes down the drain
It's a nice big size and comes in a variety of colors
"high quality, fun colors, fit easily over my shower drain and was super easy to clean"
"Such a good deal, 5 pack for $10"
Needed it to keep my hair out of the shower drain
Perfect for whah I needed
"I bought one for my mother 's sewer last time, and it 's especially easy to use"
This time I bought another for my own family
My wife 's hair loss was very serious
She successfully stopped a lot of my wife 's hair
Awesome drain stoppers seem to catch Hair and other things from going down the drain and easy to clean
Super easy to use and stops my shower from getting clogged
I ordered this because it comes with 5 drain covers and can work for a variety of uses
I have one in the kitchen sink which works very well because it is a flat steel surface
I also have one in the bathtub which so far seems to be staying well and I like that it fits over the built-in drain cover but has smaller holes so it prevents anything from going down the drain
Good colors too
"I ordered this with other products, but didn't have this one"
"Does not catch hair at all, I tried to use it in my shower, but no luck"
I will keep searching for something else
"product is functional as works as advertised ,it catches hair"
"Stops the hair from going down the drain, however, they do move around some"
I'm just happy to not have to take a snake to the drain every month to unclog the showers
They are durable and nice rubber/plastic material
The teeth will grab hair
The problem was they did not suction around our drain and would slide while the shower was running
I had to keep sliding it back over the drain with my foot
"This works well for bathtub and sink, easy to clean and looks great"
The suction cup keeps it in place and no more clogging as it collects the hair well and easy to clean
Its nice that it comes 5 in a package
I would recommend this
These simply work wonderfully and are made with durable material
I like the style of the hair catcher because it catches all lengths and with more effectiveness that others like it on the market
It's easy to install and very effective
I act bought this product to cover the drain hole and keep out water bugs
I loose a lot of hairs once I take a shower
I had a small one before
"It did catch the hair, but also it slowed the water flow"
This products are big which works really well for my big tub
It does catch the hairs and also I does not slow down the water flow
So now there will not having a lot of dirty water sticking there
It comes with 4
It is cheap and pretty
This is the second time I've purchased these
I used them in my kitchen sink
"One over the right side drain to keep food from going down, one over the disposal to keep silverware and smaller dishes out"
I highly recommend them for this purpose
Remove before placing hot pots and pans into your sink
They are not high heat resistant silicone
I was having some bug issues where they were coming from the drain
These do a great job keeping the drain covered
This product works amazing for me as I have a separate shower area
Would definitely recommend this to my friends
"Great colors, easy to install, fits any drain in shower or sink"
I like it but an annoyed with it
"It does what it's supposed to do, which is great, but i really wish it stayed in place as as soon as we turn the shower on and water flows from the spigot"
this thing floats away
"The good thing is that at least when the shower head spits water, and the tub begins to drain, you can put it back"
So yeah
wish there was some suction power
"This is what I needed, super Useful"
Easy to use
Arrived on time and works
This is a wonderful Product and works for catching my long curly hair
So easy to clean and replace too
I purchased this to see if it would be a solution to catch lose hair before cloging the drain
with slight modification to fit over the drain plug my apartment has
I have used it for almost a week and like it so far
It catches my fine hair and easy to clean out
I look forward to slowing or reducing the clogging of my shower
Great fit for our bathtub and bathroom sink ' super cute too
The do what their meant to do
Perfect for my shower
"Although there isn't any suction with this particular hair catcher, it surprisingly caught all the hair"
Best thing ever
My hair constantly sheds and clogs up our shower once in a while
This wonderful product will give you that peace of mind while showering
Catches all my hair and even pets hair
Highly recommend
No suction
Love it
Good quality and easy to use
Would recommend
Great product
Easy to use and clean
Very easy to use and good for the price we got 5
Silicon is easy to clean as well
Doesn't stop hair going under it
"This product often moves around in the shower, allowing hair to clog the drain anyway"
When it does work the hair is so hard and gross to get out of this catcher
"However, the value for the pack is manageable to just toss them when they get too dirty"
Waste of money
Works great stops my hair and easy to clean
Does well catching long hair
"Easy to place down/pick up, doesn't seem move while showering"
Very easy to install and does what its supposed to do
I have installed in all bathrooms in my house and it works perfectly
"Works well, better than expected"
Hair sticks to it and it catches hair well
The product works well
It slides just a little when the water is first turned on
Then it suctions and stays in place
The colors are very pretty
I would recommend
It works
These hair catchers are much nicer than the metal ones in that they can't rust
So happy that I made this purchase
Works as intended :)
So happy I ordered these
You really get your money's worth since there are five in a pack
It's also great that I can use them for the kitchen and bathroom sink as well
Horrible doesnt stay put and it doesnt block out the hair
I got it based on the reviews and am so disappointed
it catches hair well and it's big enough to cover the different types of drains we have in the house
Works great
It did not catch any hair
But is works great when placed under a plate or bowl to keep them from sliding around for people with disabilities
Easy to place on drain but does not trap hair as stated
Super easy to use and it stays in place
"Not a fan, did not catch hair when used in the shower"
works great
works wonders
Does the job
Great quality and easy to clean
Love the pastel colors for my very clean bathroom
My drain is large and this will help
Good product
I needed something easy to put in my shower to catch any hair and it works
Good quality and great price
I recommend these to any one looking for a quick and easy solution to not clog the drains
Sort of helpful but not as good as it looks
This is the cheapest hair catcher I could found and it works very well
We have 3 girls in the family and 1 shower
No more snaking once a month
Very flexible and very cute
Lots of Colors
This product is great
"Very easy to install and clean, and it keeps all the hair out of our drain"
Easy to use and it doesn't float away with the water
Highly recommend
Fits well in our shower
Easy to install and remove
There is no suction power
It's easy to install because you lay it down
"As soon as I turned my shower on, it slid to the side"
Disappointed
amazing product
Perfect fit for bath tub drain
Water drains quickly as normal
Fit on sink basin aswell not perfectly but atleast  its not lifted so it will still  cath hair
Love it
FIT PERFECT
Great
Y'all it's so easy to install and remove
Now no more touching drain hair
Just pick it up and dump it in the trash
Hair still gets underneath for some reason
great
I love it
No more hair clogged
Loved the colors variety
We moved into a rental house a few weeks ago
The drains for showers were wide open
"Anything could have gone in before, but we didn't want to have hair or anything stuck in there"
So far so good after 3 weeks
Some were discolored and I was hoping they would be more aesthetically pleasing in person
Purchased this for my mom and for myself to keep hair out of the bathtub drain
It's easy since you don't have to install anything and it works so two thumbs up from me
Product works great
Easy to clean and catches the hair in the shower great
And they give you quiet a few so I have enough to last a while
I bought this to use in the shower and it works well to avoid hair getting stuck in the drain
"Since there are multiple in the package, I also put one in the kitchen sink"
These are simple to use and effective for multiple uses
This works great
Only thing I would change  is the suction
Doesn't seem to stick all that well
I also wish it had a garbage catcher
Super happy with this purchase
It didn't solve my purpose
It didn't catch even a single strand of hair
"I love the colors, super cute and modern"
These do the job of catching hair and things I don't want down the drain
It says install and maybe I am confused (it did not come with instructions) you just put this down over your drain
I don't consider that installing
But it also does not suction cup to the tub or sink
Which leads me to the con of this product
It slips and slides and doesn't stay in place really well
I just received this and am pleased so far
Time will tell
I was worried that my drain is square shaped and these are round but it covered just fine
As in picture you might can see there is already hair that got trapped
The product stayed in place and didn't float around but does not really 'suction' to the surface
I feel as if this will eliminate a lot of issues in the future
I love the variety of colors available but also the product itself
It's easy to use and also easy to clean
Other items I've purchased for the same purpose we're difficult to clean and we'd end up throwing them away because we couldn't get all of the hair off
No water can get through this item
It is too thick
"So, the shower starts filling up"
It drains really slowly
Not usable
I waited 1 day too long to send it back
Looks just like the picture
I like it
This works at collecting hair very well
I used to have the mushroom hair catcher and taking off the hair from that device is a lot harder and nastier
The holes in the mushroom catcher clog up easy preventing water to flow easily
I do not have that problem with this hair catcher though
The water flows perfectly down the drain despite how much hair there is
The only thing I wish this hair catcher could do is suction better to the tub
This is the second time I've purchased these hair catchers
"Very easy to use, suction power could be stronger but that's not a big issue"
This really catches all the hair
Mine is thinning from chemo and now my drain doesnt clog anymore
"The hair pulls right out of the strainer and these were multi packs, so they were really worth the price"
This product works well for all types of sinks and bathtubs
It's easy to place and easy to clean
Catches the hair very well
They fit great in my bathroom
They stop the hair from going down the drain very well
Lots of pretty colors too
Great deal
Met expectations
Value for money
"Gets the job done, and doesn't look ugly like some of the other hair stoppers"
Great and for a great price
Wish they wouldn't slide around
I constantly have to put them back in place
Great deal
Nice material and catches the hair
I love that it lays flat in the tub to allow fir drainage and that the five colors are beautiful neutral shades to match any bath set
Easy to use
our shower has a flat drain in the center so it does move if you kick it but it's easy to use and not uncomfortable if you do step on it
Don't work
"I use one in kitchen sink so nothing falls by accident in disposal, and one over bathtub drain just for color"
"The one in shower collects very little hair and does not stay in place, so could be safety issue re: slip on it"
Awesome product
Fits perfect in my tub and keeps all the hair from going down the drain
Placed over my shower drain
It FLOATS over the water
"Not one hair was captured but underneath, there they were, gathered in the usual spot"
Too light and does not work as described
Does not have suction so does not stay in place
This product is great for catching anything you need
This product is working out very well
Seems every year or maybe twice a year I am spending money on a chemical to flush out hair clogs
Bought these to see if they could help
So far so good
I really liked the value for the price
Works great
doesn't stick to the bottom of the sink/shower like I thought it would
seems like it's good quality though
Product has worked well thus far
"Love the value for the money, the size of the catchers, and the design"
"The ""suction"" I rated lower because even with water in the tub, the catcher isn't weighted down creating a strong suction"
"But, long hair gets caught easily and can be easily pulled and discarded later"
"I assume these will last a while, since they are silicone, so I gave one away to family for their drain"
"Nice and cute, stays in place and stops most of the food debris"
I purchased 2 packages of these and tried putting them in the drains in my tub and shower
Having the little fieet on the bottom when you put the water on the plug does not stay in the drain
They move around and keep coming out of the drain
Never purchase these again
"delivered on time, easy to use and works great"
Doesn't really suction to the surface of the shower but maybe it will once I actually use the shower and it gets wet
"Hoping this works, will update if it doesn't"
I like the colors and the suction works pretty well to keep the hair out of the drain
My feet can catch more hair than this thing
"Suction is terrible, it moves after I turn on the water in the tub"
"Thus, allow hairs to flow through"
I KNOW I have more hair than the couple strand that it caught
I wanted to try something different that could be reused
In theory it sounds great but it doesn't stay over the drain as it just sits on top so it moves easily
Still prefer the flower chain hair catcher over these
Waste of money
I use them in my bathtub & all my sinks
It does a great job
It keeps my drains moving
No more plumbing issues
I liked how it fit over my drain I did not like how difficult it is to remove hair
I do not like how easy it moves while I'm showering
The water flow moves it as well
There is no suction to the tile to stay put
I will not purchase again
It works well in our shower especially with trapping hair
I love this comes in a multi- pack and was super easy to install
No more clogged drains for this household
"Extremely easy to install, extremely easy to uninstall, extremely easy to use"
They don't suction at all (idk if they're supposed to but it was a question on the review)
I wish they did though
We use ours in the shower and it catches hair very well
They look good too if that is something that matters to you
They do tend to move a little bit if kicked by your foot but that really isn't the end of the world for our use
"Good size to fit the drain, stays in place, catches hair well"
Simple product that catches all the hair- works great
The only problem is for 1 of my tubs it moves a little when tub water is turned on but the other 2 tubs it sticks nice and seems to catch well
Would recomend
"This product does keep hair from going down the drain, which is what I bought it for"
"It doesn't suction to the tub at all so when the tub is filled it floats around, but it stays in place during a shower"
"It's pretty durable and flexible, not a bad deal especially for the price"
didnt like how it kept sliding off
Per the wife:  Have not tried it out yet on the two long haired people in our family so it could potentially be a 5-star product
"Pros: It doesn't have any suction (because it's full of holes for water to go through, so"
) but the material gives it plenty of weight that should be able to keep it in place over the drain
"It has several parts that stick up to catch hair that otherwise would keep circling and possibly go through the holes, so that's good"
"The silicone material makes it ideal to stick to a clean bathtub surface, and you just put it in place"
"And yes, you will just pull all of the hair off the top of the item, and occasionally clean the bottom part when you clean the tub (of course)"
Easy peasy type stuff
Cons: don't know yet
"Note: I wrote this review in anticipation of getting a free gift card from the company/seller that would essentially cover the cost of this order, which I got on a Lightning Sale"
"Nonetheless, the opinions stated here, and any future addendums, are 100% honest thoughts about the product"
It seems to do the job
"There's hair caught up in it, so it must be working"
"In the stand alone shower, it does stay put pretty well"
"Every once in awhile I'll accidentally move it with my foot, but it's not bad"
Super pretty colors
Really needed this for the house to stop clogs
Haven't used yet but can't wait to see how it works
Returning
They just didn't work for me
Everything just went under it and into the drain
"no suction, weird and catch most but not all hair"
Save yer money
"Feels like good quality, will likely hold up a while"
This product is great
Very easy to use and does not stop up the sink
Catches the hair but still drains
Colors are very great
I have 3 bathrooms and the pack had one to match each
catches the hair great
no more clogged drains
Bought these for the showers in our rental property as the last ones cracked and discolored
"These ones are of much better quality, better value, stay in place and have small rubber bumps to catch the hair"
5 different colors and great value
"Super cute colors, great deal for the price"
Love these so much
"They stay in place, are reusable and help to keep our drains clog free"
Does the trick
Great product
Super simple
Very easy installation - works on all shower types
The colors are super cute
"The hair catcher just sits on top of the drain, but it didn't move during my shower"
Easy to clean thusfar
It caught hairs during my first use
Will update if I notice issues over time
I just laid it over the drain
There doesn't appear to be any way to make it stay in place
I love how is so easy to use and it doesn't move out of place
"The item look big when arrived, durable and cover enough space to catch the hairs"
I amGlad I found this
These are ok but not very impressive not really much suctioning power and I don't see that much hair being trapped but I know there is a lot
Easy to clean
There are 5 packs with multiple nice color
"It is flexible to put on the top of sink for my bathroom, kitchen and laundry"
It is also easy to clean when it gets dirty
Good quality
Does not work
It doesn't stop hair from clogging the drain
The cover doesn't suction well to my shower drain and will float away unless I hold it down with a shampoo bottle
Would not buy again
Excellent product
So easy to catch the long hair and easy to clean
These don't suction at all and don't catch hair at all the holes seem to be too big so the hair just goes right through
They also get moldy very fast
Waste of money

The colors are especially nice
Great item for the usability purposes
Really handy item to have for the home usage
I would say great item for the price
I give big thumb up
Great item
Larger diameter w/good grip to cover shower drain and catch all hair
Nice color selection (pack of 5)
One of the colors actually blended-in perfectly with shower marble tile & grout
Easy to clean
I purchased this item for my bath tub to catch hair from clogging the drain it catches things from going down which is great
and for my sink it fit perfectly as well catches food from going down
Great buy
Very satisfied
my shower has been so clogged so I decided to order these
I finally have something to catch the hairs that fall out in the shower
It's super cool bc it has tons of little spikes that collect any hair before they even get close to the drain
It is bigger then regular drain covers but it does the job SO well
Definitely recommend this to anyone who doesn't want there drain to clog
Great concept but mine floats away
There's no suction so it doesn't stop the hair
Doesn't stay in place
It floats in the water as other users have complained
Waste of money
Please don't buy it
Love the variety of colors
I like that I can use them in the shower to keep hair from going down the drain
"Use them in the bathroom sink to get valuables from going down the drain (ie rings, bobby-pins, etc"
Very happy with this purchase
This drain cover fits perfectly in our shower
it protector has solved our problem
I put it at the bathtub outlet to effectively block the hair from falling in
Its amazing how it catch all the hair
This item is a great idea and worth the money spent
But the suction is non-existent The disc constantly floats away and does not adhere to the drain
It will collect hair but not very much
I am bummed
"I like these Drain Covers, I was suffering from hair clogging the drain but now I have no more issues with these covers, it's easy to install it and keeps everything out, and the best thing it's easy to clean it without adding chemicals to clean the drain"
it's durable with good quality and the best price for five pieces instead of paying more to clean any clogs
Notgreat
Works great
Love the size and fits perfectly
Works as described
I've gone through a lot of drain catchers and this is by far the easiest to clean and nicest looking
It stays in place and does everything it is supposed to do
No complaints
I really like it
This product was easy to use and it worked well in catching all the hair from the shower
Easy to install:  drops right on to the drainHas durable materialGoing to save on Drain-O
Fits in for the tub\shower but way too big for any other drain in the house
Not a good but for me
It collects the hair like a dream but it doesn't stick the the bathtub so sometimes it moves but I love it
Great valued
"It's comes 5 in one pack,the size is good for the sinks"
"I gave two pieces to my cousin but her sinks are small than my so that it isn't right for her,if you want to buy this hair stopper,you should make sure the size"
"Anyway, this product is definitely right for my sinks"
"I've only had this for a few days, but so far it's doing the job"
Hair is getting caught in the spike things and it doesn't move away from the drain when the water comes on
Amazing product
Works like a charm and the colors are beautiful
"Works great, havent had any problems"
"Affordable, easy to install, effective, and shipped quickly :)"
The catchers fit perfectly over our shower drain
I live with another female and our drain always gets clogged with hair
The catchers allow us to get our hair after the shower to prevent it from going down the drain
Has caught hair really well and haven't had any major clogging in a while
Recommend this product
it fits well on my shower drain
It keeps moving and the hair does slide through the gap between the surface and stopper
Moves around too much when bathtub has water 1'or more of water or is filled with water from bath
"Works really well, keeps hair out of drain"
"Easy to clean, seems durable"
I think it will last a long time
Comes 5 to an order each one is a different color
I would recommend to friends and family
Great product
i'm not saying they dont work but i wish they had a better suction at the bottom to stay in place
Great product
Second time we order it
although the product seems smaller in the photo when I received it I was worried it wouldn't fit in the bathroom but luckily it did
im overall satisfied with the item
Very simple to use
I saw the benefit at the first use
Great buy
Amazing
Catches everything
Nice but not as bright as pictured
Bigger than I expected but I should have looked at the measurements
"I wanted this for my bathtub and it DOES NOT fit over the drain, I donated them to Good Will very disappointed"
"The product is light, easy to use and the colors are fun"
Arrived quickly
Would buy again
I bought this for my wife sink in the bathroom
It is always slow draining due to her hair
These came just in time for her to put it in place and prevent hair from going down the drain
I like that it does what it is supposed to (a guy thing) and she loves the color options and how easy it is to take and dispose of hair
She also put one in the shower and in the kitchen because she likes it much more than the stainless steel that came with the sink
She does property management and plans to order more for the tubs in the rentals
Very cheap
Doesn't stay down
Blocks water from draining
Definitely would not recommend
Super easy to install and catches all the hair
These fit great and work well in my stall shower
Works great
"It does fit in my tub drain, stay in place and the water goes down smoothly"
"The most important is it really does a gob job to catch hair, you only need a little bit work to clean the catcher after shower"
Really good product
I recently had a bad clog in my bathtub
"My husband was able to get in unclogged, but I needed something to prevent it from happening again"
Then I found this
This item prevents hair from going down my drain
Thank you
Not good for kitchen sink
move around too much
Useless gadget
Not worth buying
My tenant sheds like crazy and this product seems to be catching more hair than others I have tried
It's easy to install and clean
I live with 2 women in the house and cleaning out the shower drains had become a once a month chore
"That stopped the moment I purchased this hair stopper, now they are more than capable of cleaning their own mess"
"These are very easy to install, come in great colors"
They are made out of silicone making them very strong and durable
I have really long and thick hair that's always clogging up my shower
I've tried different drain protectors but the hair still gets through
I really like this product because it catches a lot more hair
The food gets hung up round it and doesn't stay in place
NO SUCTION
but it wasn't advertised for that
It is a nice enough weight that suction isn't needed
"It is a good size, comes in pretty colors, catches hair very well, and is easy to remove the hair and clean"
Very pleased; I would buy them again
The size of the product covers the drain but will not work well with drains that are raised and are unable to come apart
Perfect for what I needed it for
Working great
"My tub drain already has a hair catcher, but it didn't look like it would do a good job"
So I purchased this one
"I couldn't get other-shaped ones, the ones that requires inserting them inside the drains, because my tub drains hair catcher pops out a bit"
"I just put this over my drain, and it works"
"It looks good, and seems it would be durable too (silicone)"
"slows down drainage, but catches hair"
does the job
Didn't work at all
The hair catchers are useless
"The moment you turn the water on, they float away"
I should have read the negative reviews first before buying the pack
It's just what I wanted
it works great
So easy to use and clean
Doesn't slide around easily
I love that it comes in a pack so I can replace more often
Would recommend
Effective and simple solution
Good product and fits over shower and sink drains
"Very easy to install, to remove, and gets the job done"
I can't recommend this product enough
Great product
I have long hair and the drain was blocked  several times
This hair catcher solves the problem
Easy to place and remove
Very sturdy and good quality
I like the colors too
They go well with any home style
Exactly what we needed to prevent drain clogs
Our previous hair catcher would not suction properly
These stick around the drain incredibly securely and catch everything before it goes down the drain
Will save us a lot of landlord calls regarding clogged drains
"Good product in general, sometimes doesn't stay at the one place while in shower"
Loved this product
It works perfectly for protecting each of the shower drains in my house and it gives me a few to spare
I'm very pleased with the results and I love the different colors
I have very thin hair and it still catches mine
Wonderful product works a advertised
I didn't realize how much hair goes down the drain until I purchased this
It is very easy to clean and reinstall
Now that I have these I recommend them to everyone so that they do not have a problem with drains
great product
and very economic given the set
The holes are too large that can't catch the hairs
Does not work well
Works really good and easy to use
no more hair clogged drains
Very easy and simple product
"These work pretty well, not sure about the suction , but they lay flat in both the shower and the kitchen sink where I wash my hair"
They catch the hair and it cleans off easily
Good product
Doesn't work at all
Big gap between the catcher and the tub
Can not catch anything
Good product
Love these
No Mildew on the bottom
The look good
They stay in place
Great product to keep the hair out of the shower drain
Have put them in all the showers of my house
Very pretty and works great
It comes with 5 colors and great condition
Looks durable
Very easy to install
"collects long hair, doesn't clog tub, affordable"
I like the different colors
"This can effectively block hair strands and other sundries to prevent the drainage pipe from being blocked, very useful"
It does not suction at all
It always moved especially when you turn on the water
No matter how you pressed it
Not recommending
Will be buying another type
Great product
We utilized this product in our shower and one in the sink
Both work exceptionally well by preventing clogs and catching anything that went down either drain
"It is flexible and super easy to install, remove, and clean"
Surprising how far products like this have come over the years
Not at all what I expected but they get the job done
"These are great if you want to slip in your shower, have your water blocked from draining properly, and struggle pulling whatever hair they do catch on the side out"
I so wanted to love these
Back to the flower chain thingy
Bought these for my old two family
All the drains needed them
These are so cute and work well to trap hair from going down our drain
Great drain cover
"My shower drain clogs really easily, and this has helped tremendously"
"It does slide around a bit, but it catches much more hair than I expected"
"It's super easy to clean, I definitely recommend"
The drain covers are easy to install and remove to clean
They are flexible and catch a surprising amount of hair with each shower
I bought these to replace a mushroom shower hair catcher
The colors are really fun and they work really well
The silicone has enough stick to stay in place versus those old rubber like ones
doesn't stay in place
This is a great product and definitely worth the value
"There aren't any suctions on it, which I was surprised about at first, but it grips my flat drain well and, unless you step and try to slide with it, it won't move and the water drains well"
Worth the buy
This hair catcher looks beautiful and durable
I live that it's easy to install and catches all the hair that would have gone through the drainage
Love it
Does not work
Floats to the top of any water stream allowing hair or grass to flow below
"Install and remove it was easy , started floating on tub and cleaning long hair out of it is real pain"
Works well still moves around a little in the shower and need to make sure you clean out hair regularly
product works well and is easy to clean
This this goes by even stay on the drain in my apartment
I am an African American and I do wash and go hair styles most mornings and bought this product to avoid messing up our drain
"As soon as I turn on the water after placing the product over the drain, the Hair Collector floats away"
It's useless
"Works well enough, catches the hair like it should"
"It doesn't actually fit into the shower drain, it just sits on top so if you accidentally bump it, it will move and stop covering the drain and stop catching hair"
No suction power to speak of
Mine does not float but the water and hair slip beneath it more than catch on top
"I think it is because the catcher is too thick of a rubber, so the water will just trickle to the path of least resistance and is not going to ""build itself up"" just to slip over the top, as preferred"
It does catch hair
but more underneath it catches hair than the part that is supposed to
#NAME?
We recently purchased the five pack of these hair catcher as I am a VERY hairy individual
"The plop into place and can be easily taken out again, which is of a slight concern to me as I step on the drain a lot while I take a shower"
"As this type of hair catch is is a relatively for us, my insight on their effectiveness is a little limited right now"
I was amused by the question of "suction" as there is nothing on the bottom of the device that creates a suction with our style of bathtub
It simply covers the drain due to its size
Barely caught anything
I have back problems and now I'm still stuck having to bend over to wipe the hair out the tub every time
"Doesn't suction under running water either, you have to turn the water off and then place it over the drain every time"
"The variety of colors are the only positive I can give, but having 5 useless products lying around now is very disappointing"
Great product
Flexible and durable
I love it
I even used one in my kitchen
It prevents hair from clogging the shower drain
It is also easy to wash
Perfect for our bathtub
This works super well I'm so happy with the purchase and how well it works
Great value for the amount you get too
Love the product
It's way bigger than I thought it would be but it serves its purpose now the less
I have on in my kitchen sink and one in my tub
Good purchase for the price
By catching the hair before it enters the drain prevents the laborious chore of fishing globs of hair out of the drain
Love it
"Stylish hair catchers, easy to clean and over all catches all of my hair"
it gets the hair but it makes the water drain super slow
It's easy to clean and easy to install and easy to remove
Waste of money
The hair goes right under this product because it has no suction
When it doesn't it forms a circle around the edge instead if getting caught in the catcher
Doesn't do ant good
"I have clogged many a drain with my long, curly hair"
I'm so glad that I found these hair catchers
They do a great job of trapping the hair and they feel like they'll hold up for a long time
it does what its supposed to do
catches hair
its got no suction however it is quite a heavy silicon so it doesnt float around
if it does you might need to unclog ur bathtub
however there were 2 which was individually packed whereas 3 were bare naked
maybe it was a return
i didnt wanna go thru the hassle of returning this so i just gave it a good wash before placing it but i hope it wasnt used
"When I turn on the water in my bathtub, the water pushes it off the drain"
It floats when there's a lot of water in the tub too
Gets the job done
Exactly what you need
"Buy this thing maybe as the safety or for aesthetic reasons, but it doesn't really hold that much stuff in the kitchen sink, moves away from the opening"
Definitely miss-advertised as a "Hair Catcher" - will not hold the hair in my shower and those it will catch will be difficult to clean off
WIll have to buy now different product
This is an amazing product
So easy to install and it catches my very thick hair during wash days
Amazing
I absolutely love these
They are easy to install and clean up
Works great and can't beat the price
"I was using metal mesh drain strainers for my tub and bathroom sink, but the mesh was too thin and caught everything, including spit when brushing my teeth (yuck)"
"I needed to clean them after every shower, which was a pain, and even with that, they started molding after about a month"
"I decided to try something new, so I bought this product and it works well for the tub/shower, but they're just too big for the bathroom sink"
These are like 5 inches in diameter
"I'm also testing one out for the kitchen sink, but I haven't used it enough to decide if I will keep it there or not"
"For the tub, it seems to catch my long hair but I don't know how well it works on my husband's body hair"
It seems like they might make it past the rubber nubs if there's enough water flow
"I'm not really sure how to test it, but it doesn't seem to be filling up like the metal mesh one did"
"That does mean the tub doesn't start filling up towards the end of my shower like with the mesh one, which I appreciate"
It stays in place well and is easy to move
"For the bathroom sink, it takes up most of the bottom of my small curved sink"
"It stays in place even though the bottom isn't flat, but water builds up above the sides and sits under the drain cover, which has caused build-up of what I call ""sink grime"" after only a few days"
"For the kitchen sink, it fits nicely and stays in place well, and I appreciate it being soft and rubbery to protect dropped dishes a bit more"
"It seems to catch larger food scraps pretty well, but I don't know how often it will need to be cleaned yet"
"I would recommend this product for bathtubs so far, but I still need to see if I can test how much hair it's actually trapping"
I liked the colors
They were very pretty
They added a nice aesthetic to the room
They are also very effective
I like the durability of this product
Previously used metal screen and prefer the silicone
So far happy with the product
Our drains have been getting clogged with my hair and we needed something easy to catch the hair before going down the drain
Love the colors
Prettier in person
Works great for long hair and easy to use
No suction but does stop the hair from going down your drain
It sort of just sits on the floor of your tub/shower
The lack of suction means it's easily moved
"I have medium-length hair and am fairly healthy, but I get a bunch of hair in my sink and tub that I have a hard time getting out before it starts clogging the drain"
Lots of really fine hair - so I looked at several of the items made for correcting the problem and decided on these
The first shower I laid one of these over the drain and at the end of my shower I could see all the hairs clinging to the edges of the cover over the drain - problem solved
"The one in the bathroom sink is a bit more problematic in that it more or less pops up at the back of the sink just under the faucet due to the tighter curve there, but so far it has stopped most of the hair and that's what I wanted"
These work great
Horrible product
"Waste of moneyIt does not stay in place, theres no suctioning for that purpose"
The material is too thick so the hair go under it instead
Don't waste your money
I have a shower only with the center of the floor is where the drain is
"It's not a flat surface but it appears to cover the drain well, with no issues"
It doesn't move at all
"I have a second bathroom where I need to remove the stopper before this can be put it in, will update once I do"
It's a guest bathroom that doesn't get used much
Been using it a week and the hair catcher hasn't seemed to move at all
"It's a soft texture so even if you step on it, you won't move it or feel it that much"
"These look great but they don't auction hardly at all, so they catch no hair unless it's big clumps"
"Great, easy to use"
Probably wouldn't work with a pop up drain
works well if no stopper
colors are pretty
Great colors and catches the hair
Does the trick
"Put it in my shower and my bathtub, both my siblings hates it"
The hair gets stuck and it's very hard to remove the hair from the silicone
They come in various colors
They fit the shower drain and work for the tub also
I think this is really a nice product
Easy to clean
This product doesn't work well as a hair catcher because the slits are too big
The hair still gets through
"Works great, it catches all my dogs hair now I don't have to worry about my shower clogging"
Awesome product
Highly recommend for tub
I put this in my bathtub to catch hair as I shed a lot
It doesn't move around much which is good and is easier to install and remove than the Tub shrooms
It catches hair fairly well even though some will stick to the sides instead of getting on top but it is all still easy to remove after your shower
I bought this needing something to stop clogging my drain from all the postpartum hair I've been losing
It's been a game changer
Slips like crazy we ended up not using them
We have a flat drain so maybe that's why but it doesn't stick
Way too small and no suction at all
They just slip off the drain constantly and in my farmhouse sink it slips into the drain
Totally useless
"Like the effectiveness of catching hairs, which is the main purpose of me getting the product"
Completely removed
drain clog issues since
My favorite part about this product is that it advertises how easy it is to 'install' cause there is none
You trip and drop the thing and it's 'installed'
"Despite nothing holding it in place, it stays pretty well during a shower, and I was surprised by how much hair it caught"
"There may be better products, I'll give you that, but for something so cheap that works so well it is definitely worth it"
Kept all the hair from going down the drain
Easy to remove and clean
"I have medium-length hair and seem to shed almost as much as my cat, but the drain protector catches it all and is easily removed and tossed away"
"Best of all, in my case, the silicone hasn't held onto mildew or mold -- I have been able to spray and wipe away any grime with very little effort"
It looks like this drain protector will last a very long time
This has been a very worthy purchase for the few dollars more
Came very quickly
Love the colors and super easy to just plop on top of the drain
"Only thing is, it's loose so it does tend to slide around easily so I am constantly shifting it back to the right place"
I found them unsatisfactory
"This product is awful, doesn't stop any hair , the hair keeps  slipping under the silicone because it does not adhere firmly to the shower or sink drain"
"One package come with 5 pieces, they are different colors,looks pretty"
"The quality is great with silicone, easy to place and remove for both baths and showers"
They catch the hair and cleans off easily
The size fits well in kitchen sink too
Worth the price
"As much as I wanted to like this product, it didn't work well for me"
The colors are very pretty but hair partially goes through the holes and gets stuck and I have to one by one pick and pull the hair out
"I also suspect hair slips below the product and escapes because it doesn't stick and with the previous product I used, there was way more hair that would get caught"
Great product
Easy to install and even easier to clean
"With long, thick hair my drain kept clogging but not anymore because of this product"
Will recommend to friends/family
"We have old house, slow drain, so water floats the thing away from drain and hair goes down, there is no ring under it to hold in place, i am going back to the mushroom that sticks in drain"
Love the size of this shower drain hair stopper
It's surprisingly hard to find a silicone one that fits over a 5 inch drain
No complaints so far
Seems to stick onto the shower floor decently well
The product does catch hair
"However the water lifts it for stuff to get underneath and doesn't let enough water go down the drain , thus causing more of a problem"
used it for my tub works nicely
Does what is says
So easy to use
Catches all of my long hair
"Great for hair, my daughter and I have long hair, and a ton of it, so these have worked great for us"
Just started using them
Much better compared to the ones you insert
These dont have suction power but they do trap the hair
Wasn't exactly what I wanted but it is fine
Had these in our showers for 2 weeks and it caught absolutely nothing
Would not recommend at all
I watched the hair just casually go right down the drain every time
"It does not work well in showers, because it hampers the water from draining out"
"The result is that you find yourself standing in a rising pool of water until you turn off the shower, and then the water drains out so slowly that much hair is left on the shower floor"
Seems to work well so far
"We were skeptical about it catching hair when we first put it down, but after one use we saw it did a great job catching hair"
"It does tend to move a good bit for a drain that is in the shower but nothing that is too bothersome, just wished it suctioned a little better around the drain"
Slides around some but it works pretty well
Overall I'm satisfied with the product
Doesn't stay put in the shower but good for the sink disposal to keep stuff from falling down the drain
These things do catch quite a bit of long hair but it drives me nuts that this thing creates a small puddle to force the water through the top
I cant stand standing in a puddle so I dont care for these
This product looks great
it catches hair and does a good job at looking fabulous
It does it's job
"We have spent months trying to figure out how to fix our drain from clogging with hair, and nothing has worked"
This product was our answer
Super easy to put on and take off your drain and catches anything you don't want going down
Highly recommend
Catches hair in the tub well and I line the colors
"One package come with 5 pieces, there are different colors and look nice"
"I put it on top my shower drain, the size is perfect, so far works good, can catch hairs"
"But after using it, it's not easy to take off the hairs from it"
These are great
Big enough for tub or sink
I got this primarily for my bathroom sink because anything that goes into the pipe collects gunk and starts to smell
We also had a problem with water backing up
But this solves all my issues
I even replaced what I had in the bathtub And garage sink with one of these
"And the beautiful, modern colors are a bonus"
My hair has been shedding a lot lately which is causing my shower to clog up really fast
I got tired of cleaning it out constantly so I bought this hair catcher to keep the hair from going down the drain
"It literally is such a time saver, I just dump it after my shower and never have to worry about clogging anymore"
Works well - catches hair while also allowing water flow
"Excited to see how well this works over time, but so far very impressed"
very effective & useful
This thing works
You might have to reposition it when you turn the water on
It catches the hair
I'd rather almost do anything than get hair out of a drain
So glad I got this product
I'd attach a photo but who wants to see that
Perfect to keep the drain from clogging
We have a lot of hair in our household and this has kept us from having to snake the drain or use draino constantly
shower drain -- it will not stay over the drain
"It's very useful, been keeping the shower drain from getting grossly clogged again, and it stays in place so there's no worries about anything slipping"
"Meh, catches some hair but not everything"
I put it over the drain in my shower
"It slides around a little bit, but not much, which is the good part"
"And I do always see hair trapped in it, but when I pick it up to clean it out after a shower I see hair still on the drain, meaning not everything is caught"
"I still think it's worth the price for so many in a pack, it's just not quite as effective as I hoped (but a better option than nothing"
Moves around
"Zero suction, so I returned it"
Works well
easy to clean
"Item doesn't suction to the floor it just sits on top of drain, can be moved off it pretty easily, other than that the colors are nice and they fit my drain perfectly"
Great product great price
"I have not have this product for long, but from the material and design, it appears to be a good product"
"Since it is fairly inexpensive, I'm planning to replace it often so no messy hair to clean"
It's a good value
The quality of it pretty good
It's makes so easy to pick up hairs without messy and it's easy to clean
Good purchase for the home  essential
Great
Does the job
I haven't used it yet but I'd like to decrease having to remove hair clogs and this looks pretty functional
The contours fit on top of a metal drain and there are bumps on the outer inch which catch hair that flows down from the shower
I think that the holes are slightly smaller or more narrow but the idea is to catch hair and just having a set of holes that doesn't align with the holes in the drain underneath should catch most hair
I don't think that we needed five of them but we'll have replacements if we ever need them
"The suction isn't that great, but it still does the job of keeping all the hair out of my drain"
"I live in a building that's over 100 years old and the plumbing sucks, so this saved me a lot of money buying Drano"
I'm glad this product is available on Amazon for quick shipment because it's so convenient
"I just don't really like the little bumps at the outer ring, seems like it'll be hard to clean"
The pricing is good enough to just replace one they get dirty though
Love the colors --  colorful yet classy & muted -- as well as the durable silicone material
It works well for blocking hairs in the sink as well as filtering other particles
I initially bought this for our kitchen
"While it didn't work that well there, it was perfect for the bathroom"
Works great
"Not fancy, just does the job, and comes in a pack of 4"
Doesn't really fit a traditional shower drain
They fit my sink but not the shower which is what I was needing it mostly for
You would think that a product whose sole function is to catch hair would catch hair
You'd be wrong
"I mean, it says ""Colorful Hair Catcher"" right on the box"
"It's colorful, but it catches hair as well as I run a three minute mile"
I'd love to think that only two hairs fall from my head when I take a shower
I know better than that
This thing catches an average of two hairs per shower
I've been counting
Some showers it actually catches zero hairs between my wife and I
The only hairs it catches are the lazy hairs that really aren't trying at all
Any hair with an ounce of gumption runs through this thing like a champ
"You might ask, ""Why then does is have so many good reviews"
" Go read the reviews again
Most people are commenting on the beautiful colors or the wonderful size
The only people who really say much about its hair catching abilities are the people with hair down to their knees
A slice a grapefruit could probably catch those hairs
Another reason for the good reviews may be that they include a little card that promises a $10 gift card if you visit some website and leave a review
If you want a piece of Chinese rubber that won't sit still and waves at hair as it streaks down the drain, then spend $10 on this
If you're dazzle by the nice texture, neat colors and the promise of a gift card, then throw it in the cart
However, if you're actually looking for a product that keeps hair out of a drain, go elsewhere
We were looking for something to provide a consistent hair catcher in our bathroom tub and, finally
We've got it with this nifty product
From our household of six to our trio of dogs, we no longer have to worry about clogs and purchasing drain items from Costco
The catcher has stopped the hair and allowed us to no longer worry
The fact that it comes with five was awesome as we've used it not only in the bathroom tub, but bathroom and kitchen sinks
It's versatile and easily cleaned, placed and removed
It's easy to install, easy to clean, easy to remove AND I love the variety of colors
I love everything about this product
The colors are awesome and it does not allow any hair to escape down the drain
Not what I tough it was
Looks nice but the holes are too big and hair goes into the drain
Sorry I bought this
In a home with 4 ladies, the drain thanked us after we installed this
First theres no installation needed
Just drop on top of the drain and it will catch all the hair
Second, it does really catch all of it
I did not know how much hair was going down the drain until I used this
This product is okay at keeping hair out of the drain, however it does not always stay in place
Too big for my sink drains
It's simple to install and clean
It does catch hair which is great and why I wanted this
It doesn't stay over the drain when faucet is on before pulling up lever for shower to start, but is fine once shower head is only source of water
I think its excellent
Great colors and cheap enough you can switch them out so they don't get yucky
These are just the right size for my shower
They are easy to install and easy to remove catches all of the hair which makes for a much easier clean up
These sure did the job
great product
I've been looking for one like this for about a year
The hair catcher does its job
It took me less than 10 seconds to install it
I've only had it for a day, and so far it works very well
It's going to save me some money in the long run
Very practical
Not only for the kitchen sink, but also for the bathroom drain
It's very effective in preventing hair and vegetable leaves from reaching the drain, preventing the drain from clogging up
It's easy to use, it makes my drains less dirty, and it's great
I think I'll buy some more
They are colourful and do their job mostly
They slide out of the way and spill everything down the drain though the second you pour water in your sink which defeats the purpose of them
Easy to install and easy to clean
Seems to catch most of my hair and keeps the drain unclogged
These do not stay in place
Love love these
Just moved into my new house and bought these for my bathrooms since i loose a lot of hair when i shower or blow dry it and they go perfect in the bathtub and I also placed them in the sink
Love this purchase
The suction could be better but it does come in a 5 pack for a good price
Used in tub and sinks
Caught my dogs hair after baths
We have been using these for a couple weeks now
We have been happy with them
We have a shower/tub setup
The pop-up drain is no longer working (the cross bars that hold it corroded away)
So we only use the pop-up piece when using the bathtub
Normally we leave it out of the drain so I needed something to catch hair or dropped items like razor covers, etc
I decided to try these out
The only issue I have had, which is small, is when we turn the water on the hair catcher may move a little
This is expected as its a hard stream of water directly over the hair catcher
When we send the water to the shower head we move it back over the drain if needed
After this it works perfectly
It has been catching hair and is easy to clean
It doesn't move once the shower is running and will not float off the drain
We are happy with our purchase
I hope this helps with anyone debating getting these
These cover every drain in my house and do catch the hair, but I had a problem at first with them not staying in place
So I contacted the company, and they sent me a replacement with detachable suction cups
Now this product is perfect
Excellent customer service
Hopefully they have changed to this version
My favorite thing is how there's no weird plastic smell since it's silicone
Awesome
These drain covers are very flexible and they do the job
I just put it down and done
When showering a golden retriever there's a lot of hair going down the drain
not anymore
This catches most if not all
Awesome product, finally something to help stop our drains from clogging
With three girls in the house, this was much needed
Just recieved it
Works well so far
Excellent at trapping hair in bathroom shower and sink
Did not stay in place at all
This is larger than I thought
I works great in my standalone shower, but is too large to work well with the tub-shower combo
It is easy to clean and seems to be doing a good job
These do not stay put when you place them
If they decide to stay put, it does the job and catches the hair but I find myself having to constantly move it back into place in my shower
In my sink, it is small enough that it doesn't move
Also in another shower I put it in, it affects the drainage, but not the for the other shower
The logistics speed is very fast, and it can be received in three days
Open it and see, every color are very cute and beautiful
It's kind of like candy
I really want a bite
They are soft rubber products, feel very soft and comfortable
All aspects are consistent with the product description
I put them in bathtubs, washbasins and kitchen sinks in various rooms, each of which is helping me reduce the potential trouble of sewer blockage
The effect is also very effective
I hope I never have to clean up my blocked hair and debris in the drain again
This product is perfect for our stall shower and also our kitchen sink
No longer worried about damaging clogs in pipes
Attractive muted colors too, plus very easy to clean
I like that they come in a 5- pack so they can be disposed of when they wear out
Works great
I love it
Would buy again
Fast shipping and good customer service
I love that I can use these in my shower without having to worry about having to pull the hair out of my drain
Great product
Catches lots of hair
Can't believe how much was actually going down the drain
It can be placed directly in the bathtub
It's easy to use and good price
Does a great job catching hair in my shower
Doesn't suction very well to the shower floor but it is easy to remove to clean
Great value for price
Bathtub clogs are a huge problem in my home
I personally wash my hair often and unfortunately have to deal with hair clogs
This did exactly what I needed - captured the hair and prevented it from going down the drain
I purchased an expensive steel one from Home Depot that did nothing
I found these online and was skeptical but it works
Large enough to cover any sized drain
This is Placed over the drain and seems to catch as much hair as I was doing with out it
It does slow down the water going through the drain as it covers some of the drain openings
So far so good
Great easy to use product
Super easy to clean
Does not stay in place so is useless
It was fun for my wife to pick a color for our bathroom and they are keeping the hair out of our drains
So, I'd say we are happy with the product : )
I'm trying to figure out how this has as many good reviews as it does
This thing does not stick at all
I put one in my bathtub to catch my hair, and I also put one in my kitchen sink to catch large food particles
Both look great when they're just sitting there but they don't work at all
For the kitchen sink, everything piles up on the outside of the drain catch because it is too tall to actually go over the sides and get caught in the middle
And for the bathtub, my hair just slides right underneath it, if I'm lucky it will somehow get stuck on the bottom part that is smooth
I would return this if I could, but I have already used two
I have contacted the company about their poor product but have yet to hear anything back
This is a waste of money and I would highly recommend looking elsewhere if you want something that actually works
I shed a lot of hair and these hair catchers save not only me having to buy a solution, but also a call to the plumber
They are easy to place in the shower and easy to remove
They have great suction power and do not slide when they get wet
They also are nice-looking
Thank you
This fits our shower perfectly
I like it so much more than the mushroom drain catchers
I placed them in my sink and shower and fit perfectly
They won't move and they are easy to clean
I like these, but they have 0 suction
With the slightest movement of water, these things fall away from the drain
I'm curious to see how these actually work
They are a bit larger than I anticipate needed but it seems like they could work well
Time to take a shower
This is great for the shower
It does move but overall I am happy with it
I tried in the bathroom sink but it doesn't fit well on a pop up stopper
It works well and stays put, easy to clean
Works well with my flat shower floor
Good price, packaging, prompt delivery
Nothing fancy but who cares
These are very simple to install and they work
You just cover the drain with this thing and that's it
Some of the other types of stoppers and innovative products wind up not fitting or being too hard to install
Keep it simple
These work just fine, hassle-free
The product comes in multiple stoppers in nice colors which I loved and the price caught my eye
However it doesn't really work
It does not have any kind of suction to stick in the tub nor has a lower part to go inside the drain and stay in place
The hair just goes around it and go right under it through the drain
The stopper just floats in the tub and It only catches the hair that falls directly on it other than that everything is going down the drain
They all came with a very very strong chemical smell which I did not like either
Unfortunately they are totally useless
I have 3 long hair ladies in my household, I have to spend a lot of time on cleaning those fine hairs after shower everyday, but it still got clogged frequently
I am tired of that, so I looking for some better way to solve this
One day I saw this on the Amazon, it said hair catcher and the price is good for try
I decided to have a try, it came with 5 cute colors and the material is great
The most important thing is that it works great so far
It solved my problem and save my time on cleaning
It's very easy to install and clean
Plus it won't lower the flowing speed when there's hair clogging
It's really a lifesaver and worth every penny
Easy to use
I love that it came with multiple and I put them in both of my bathroom sinks and bathtubs and I'm obsessed I love them
When I take a shower, it won't be turned over by the water
That's a good point for this thing, I think
In addition, it effectively prevents my hair going to the sink
I just started using this product, but so far am pleased with its performance
The colors are nice, and it is large enough to fit over a variety of drains, and substantial enough to stay in place
I am pleased with this purchase
It does not catch the hair in the drain, I still get clogging and pull stuff out of the drain weekly
It also moves all the time, I'm not even sure why we still use it
May work better for a sink catching food or larger things
They are pretty but not good for catching hair
The range of colors means they won't clash with most bathroom color schemes, and the silicon means they won't stain easily or rust
I also find that, having an older bath, that too many of these won't fit my drain, and this simply goes over the hole
Muy buen producto
These Silicone Hair Stopper Shower Drain Covers are very flexible and fit to my shower drains
They are very easy to install and catch all the hair in the shower
Easy to clean too
Hope they will last for a couple of years
Great product, easy to use
Maybe it has more to do with the fact that my faucet leaks and water runs over the cover and moves it around during my shower time
They are super cute but I for sure need to find a smaller one to go under it but that's probably just due to my weird shower
This product doesn't really do what it's meant for
It floats in the tub and hence fails to capture hair in the drain
Easy to install, easily catches hair prior to going down drain, and easy to remove hair
So happy to have several colors to choose from and rotate through when deep cleaning
Have been looking for something like this for upstairs tub
Daughter with long hair
Will provide a few of these to family members as stocking stuffers
Doesn't do anything but create mess in your bathroom
I returned already and have the UPS LABEL but did not get my money back
SAME ON YOU
Works well
I no longer have a clogged bathtub drain or kitchen sink drain
I wish the suction was a bit better because it moves a bit, but it gets the job done
Since I just redid my shower, I thought I should prevent clogs
Ordered these & was delighted with the colors & it was easy to place on the shower drain
However, the issue was the water didn't drain well
The hair catcher acted like a dam
No need for a long paragraph, it works well
These are a good wide shower drain cover
The silicone material doesn't slip and it grabs the hair
Very easy to clean, too
This is just what I was looking for
Works so well
I always struggle with whether to let my hair go down the drain since I have had problems in the past with drains getting clogged due to this
So I was looking for something that would catch the hair, but also be easy to clean so it doesn't go down the drain
This products catches the hair nicely, but is not simply a wipe off item
This is good, though, since hair does not get through
It just takes a bit to get the hair off of it and throw it away, but really not a big deal
I'm quite happy with the collection of silicone drain covers
Every drain in my house is a different size but these fit every one of them including large drain in the sink kitchen
And the colors went well with my bathroom and kitchen decor
One added bonus, the silicon drain cover gives my large glass mixing bowl something to rest on when I'm washing it so it doesn't bang around the sink
Solid product, though getting the suction can be a bit hard at first
nice products
thanks a lot
use one each on ground floor bath and second floor bath
Both work very well
Does its job
Easy to use, easy to clean
Nice colors
5 for a very low price
Its exactly what it should be
I'm losing a significant amount of hair due to Covid-19, particularly when washing my hair in our stand alone shower
The hair catcher works great at both collecting clumps of hair and finer amounts, although it does slow the drainage down a bit
It's easy to clean after each use
However, I also tried it in my sink, where lots of hair is ending up from routine brushing/styling
Because the drain cover makes no allowance for the drain to be up"", it is less effective"
I was aware of that from earlier reviews
"What surprised me is that it appears to have damaged the finish on my sink around the drain, perhaps from delaying water from draining"
I would NOT recommend us in sinks or tubs that have raised "stoppers"
"These hair catchers are easy to install, and they look good in our bathtubs"
I highly recommend these if you have a problem with shower drains getting clogged
Good product
Easy to install
Wish it came with suction to hold it in place
I ended up using double sided tape but now I cant just take it off at anytime to clean it
It's a good deal for the number you get in this package
I have only started using it so will update again later
So far it meets basic needs
"However, I am not sure how effective it is for catching hair as I have long straight hair"
"Like colors, collects hair easy to pick up and clean"
Perfect for the job
Excellent delivery time
Like the colors and shape
Thanks
"It works okay, but not the best hair catcher I've used"
It's pretty and a simple device
But not all of the hair is caught in it
"The holes are bigger, so my husbands shorter hair goes through"
My longer hair doesn't always get caught in there
But it's a fine catcher for the price
Does what it's supposed to do
Great product
I have long hair and shed a lot
This has done really well to catch the hair
After trying other hair catchers that would not stick at all I ordered this pack from Amazon
It stays in place nicely and does a good job of catching my hair
I can easily remove and wash it/put it back in place when others take a shower who do not need it
Suction is not good so it moves around
It seems like it catches hair but let go some in the drain as well
Easy to use
But it doesn't  work as expected
Keeps moving without staying in place
Im having a long hair so im looking for hair strainer to hold the  hair that has fallen off
It helps us not to drain all of those in the shower
It has variety of color u can chose on
These things work like a champ
"They do shift without too much force, so nit can shift during a shower if you nudge it with your foot, but its nothing a slight nudge back cant fix"
"And they catch hair great, the little nubbins do their job well"
This product moves if there is too much water in the tub or the tub faucet turns on ( when we shut off the shower ) my drain is flat and it doesnt suction at all to the drain/tub
Very Nice
"Product works as advertised, excellent item to catch hair in the bath tub"
It's has a wide coverage area so it fits different size drains
It's stays in place and collects well
It's easy to clean
"These truly do work in your kitchen or shower, very good price"
Simple to use and does the job
Works great
"Easy to use ,worth the money"
great product
caught the hair well
This item will float and moves around alot
Good value
Lays nice and flat
Super easy to use
I inboxed and added them to the sink and bathtub in under a minute
easy to remove and remove
Didn't work for my house
Very comfortable and flexible
Easy installation placement
Doesn't inhibit the water flow into the drain
I use this in my shower
"Sits well, catches the hair easily, not sure difficult to clean hair off of"
It has become moldy though and I bought it perhaps ~3 months ago
"it's very easy to install ,i lost a lot of hair while I washing my hair"
"it one help to blocks hair from flowing into the sewer'first time I tried to take off the hair after I done shower ,it is hard remove the hair and Stick together,the best way to remove hair is wait for it get dry"
then u can very easily take away the hair
it helps
Works as described
Received product as described and it fits our shower stall perfectly
Having 5 of these is very convenient for when a replacement is needed
Hoping that this will prevent our pipes from clogging again because of my long hair
The colors are pretty too and is a very nice plus
Good value pack
This is a great product really works so far
I was originally hung up on those steel cups that go inside the drain but boy are those messy
"So when I saw the silicone ones, I leapt at the chance"
The drain covers were larger than I expected but fit perfectly over the drain and the suction seal looks like it fits great
Can't wait to try it out
Fits great and easy to remove and clean
They do exactly what they're made for
Just be sure to clean them out every few days or your water in the shower will begin to stand around the drain
I like the fact that this package comes with multiple ones
You get what you pay for - it does catch hair in the shower
I like that we have some many different colors and i can match them with my bathroom
Con: there is no suction so it does flow away when I pour water into the sink
"Well, it is a hair catcher for the bathroom after all"
Fits both kitchen sink and tub
We have an old tub with a removeable stopper so it fits it well
Hopefully this stops future clogging
"easy to use, works well"
Super simple and easy to use
Also pretty durable
Larger than expected which is nice because it ensures nothing slips through the side
Works well to catch all the hair as the shape and material help tangle it in each little part
The suction power could be better as it does move around slightly
It stays for the most part and nothing really gets by it
"It seems pretty universal too as it is a medium size, suitable for most drains"
"Although this shower drain catch does not attach to the shower floor, it stays in place"
It i big enough to completely cover my drain and find lots of hair in the catch
I got 5 for the price
"It's a set of five, worth the price"
"I like it that the set comes with different colors, exactly like the picture showed"
"The quality is great and with silicon, I'm expecting it to last longer"
(My old plastic hair catchers all seem to degrade after a while
") The size fits well in kitchen sink too, great to have another way to use it"
I loved how easy the product was to install and to remove
I wish it would suction/stick to the drain
This product did not sit flush on the tile around my drain
It impeded the flow of water and stopped the suds so that I had to take it off to rinse out the shower
I was not pleased at all
Good value for pack of five
Initially thought it didn't work but when place it correctly then it is good
The size of this packs is pretty good size for bath but not for sink
Super easy to put down and totally snatched up my long hair
Only con is we can't use it in the tub that has a pop-up drain as it sits totally flat
Very cute colors and does the job
super easy to clean as well
The colors of these are beautiful
Neutral and blend right in
"I currently have the gray one in my shower, and you can't even tell it's there because it just looks like part of the drain"
These are such a simple solution to such a common problem that those of us with thick hair often encounter
"Also, it doesn't tear up your feet if you accidentally step on it because the rubber is nice and flexible"
Get this
You won't be disappointed
It didn't suction too well on my shower or sink but it's great to catch any hair that falls
My wife needed a new hair catcher because the one she used was not doing the job anymore
"This catcher has a different structure that catches the hair much better and also keeps it inside so it doesn't touch my feet when I go into the shower (uggghh, yeah that's what you are thinking right now) so I'm also happy with it"
Very well made material
Easy to install and clean
Seems like high quality material
Nice to have multiples for the different showers and tubs in the house
Fits right over the standard drain
Does tend to move if stepped on but not terrible
Time will tell to see how long they last before they need to be replaced
Overall - pretty decent for the price point
Seems good
I was a little worried that this was not going to work out the was I wanted but turns out it is great
It is easy to remove for cleaning and reinstall
It does exactly what it's supposed to
easy to install and use :)
This is very light weight and floats with water
Not of much use
Works great catches all the hair and easy to clean off
I let the hair dry first then just wipe it away
Great product and great value
Works really well in our tub and sink
Come with 5 and has really cute colours
exactly as pictured
seem to work well
Pretty good
"It's not very sticky, but it solves the hair problem"
These are well made and easy to use
You simply cover the top of the drain and it does the rest
It catches all of the hair from the shower preventing it from clogging up
You simply pull the hair off and throw it away
Great product and beautiful colors
It really grabs the hair
So easy to clean
I ordered these for the aesthetic until we can get a new tub
"The previous home owners painted the tub and the paint has started to chip away at the drain, which isn't a great look"
These cover up the area exactly how I had hoped
I didn't expect them to be a great hair catcher but have been surprised that they work really well
These colors are way nicer to look at over the plastic drain hole covers that are filthy and gross after 2 showers
"Excellent, I have a lot of open drains and this is a simple, easy to clean, and durable product"
A great deal
I love this product
I bought a more expensive version about 2 months ago because someone recommended it
It was so much more expensive and it didn't even work
It caught very little hair and would just make the water stay in the tub when taking a shower
"This product was cheap, easy to install and worked great"
It comes with 5 of them which last a while and it collects all my hair
I have a lot of hair and it works great
loved this product for the ease of cleaning everything it catches out of the teeth
Other products that go inside the drain tend to get moldy but this one does not
"I only wish the suction was a little better so it would stay in place, that way I could use it for the kitchen"
"These are squishy from the mateiral it's made of, so it won't bother your feet if you step on it(it doesn't fit into any drains I have so it rest on top)and it's good at catching the majority of hair"
"and reasonably easy to clean out too, if you have an old hairbrush you can just use it to clean it too"
"Just brush across it and the hair will be pulled out, then just grab the clump and toss it in the trash"
It's a hit more effective
"They will build up soap scum, so regular rinsing off is needed, but you gotta do that anyway because of the hair so it doesn't add any work"
Liked the product
Easy to install and big enough for out large drain
I put it both in kitchen sink and bathtub
It functions well to catch all kinds of wastes
"I had one of those silver mesh drain covers for my bathtub but the holes were so narrow, any little thing would make it clog"
This catches the hair & lets water flow through
I like the soft colors and it has stuck well to the bottom of the shower
"Great product, won't work on tubs that have a pre-installed stopper though"
This is mainly for flat drains
But works great on my other tub
Great product
Love these
Work great & Easy to use
I have had problems with my shower constantly clogging from my hair and it was so difficult and gross to try to get it out of the drain
Finally I sought out something that would prevent it altogether
This works really well for me
As other reviewers stated it can slide around a bit but the dip in the middle sits down in the drain so it's not able to move enough to allow anything past it
It collects all my hair because there are tiny little spikes it gets caught on and it very easily just pull it off and dispose
This has been a true life saver
"These are really nice, pliable, and fits multiple drains in my home"
"I have very long, thick, heavy, hair, so these are necessary"
"I have them in my bath tub, bath sink, and kitchen sink"
I like the colors too
"This does float up a little bit, but once the shower is going, it works great"
Love these little stoppers
Fits great and works perfectly
These work great
I've been trying to find something like this for a while
"So far so good,  We bought these to help catch hair in the bathtub to keep it from clogging"
Its working just as it said
Working as expected
Product just floats in the water and doesn't catch anything
Waste of money
It attracts decent amount of hair
These work great for catching hair and easy clean up
"I set it over the drain in my tub, but as the water hits it, it moves away from covering the drain"
Pretty useless
These are great
"They seem durable, i love the colors, and they do the job just right"
I have long hair and this is a must for keeping hair out of the drain
Would definitely purchase again
"Since I love Blueberries, it is necessary to block the garbage disposal opening as I wash the fruit"
"I have to say that these do not stay positioned right above that opening, but rather than having this securely stay in the forrect position, I feel it is worth effort to use"
Came exactly as shown but I do wish it wasn't as big but overall amazing item would definitely recommend if you are looking for something like this
I just got/used this hair stopper and it was great with my very long hair
"Tbh, I mainly got this with hopes that it would stop my boyfriend's short, tightly curly hair and that remains to be seen"
However
great news
"I used this stopper on top of the strainer I already have, thus simplifying measuring its efficacy, and none of my hair went under this stopper"
"Moreover, I usually have to clear hair away throughout my shower so water can pass"
Never did that tonight
"I anticipated a flimsy grip, given there's no suction cup, or screw, etc"
", but it remained in place during my shower--even when I directed the water flow from the nozzle directly on top of it"
"My water pressure isn't bad, but I'm sure different results turn up with higher pressure"
"I never tried to remove the stopper, so have no input on that front"
Fingers crossed that my guy's hair is stopped tonight
"Again, that's the only reason I got this"
Loved the different colors
Great pricing for 5
I can use them all around the house
Easy to use
Perfect for keeping hair out of the drain
Seems to work fine
This does great in my shower
Catches lots of hair
Not so great in the kitchen sink
No suction at all
Super easy to use
You just place it over the drain
Ok this was a lightning deal so for the price and quantity it's great
"HOWEVER, they do not stick to your drain or even suction down to it"
They just lay there
When you run bath water it will float away and doesn't like to stay during the  bathtime itself; probably  water movement keeps it from staying in place
The shower is a bit better but just don't touch it with your feet because now you have to scootch it back into place
Now when you're done with bath or shower the suctioning force of the drain pulls it into place and grabs the hair so YAY
I would not recommend these tough becuase they just don't stay put
does what it's meant to :)
Used to catch hair in tub
These are terrible
They do not work at all
As soon as you put them on and the water hits them they float away and don't catch anything
They look cute but don't work
Love it
works quite well
Easy to use and works well
Like the ease of installing the product and removing it
Serves the purpose
Alternative to liquid based dissolvents for the bath tubs
I've been looking for a good strainer for my bathtub and I'm so glad I stumbled upon this one
I love the different colors that came included in this pack
It's good material and flexible
The application of it onto the bathtub was also fairly easy and simple to remove
These work great
Drain always clear of hair in shower
Easy application and works better than other options
Also I like that you get multiple in one order so you can put one in all your drains
The drain cover didn't work well in my shower/tub
"The water wouldn't go down fast enough and would build up as I was showering, leaving me standing in a puddle as I showered"
We bought these to catch hairs from going down and clogging the shower drains
"While they look neat, they really don't work"
The slits in the covers are too wide and allow the hairs to slip right past
"I put one in the shower place, it could not be able to catch any hair"
"And it is too light, water can wash it away"
Great product
Comes with 5 just enough for all the drains in my household
definitely recommend
I really like these
Easy to use and does what you expect
I gave one to a family member as well and she likes it
"We also are using one in the kitchen sink when rinsing ""chunky"" dishes cuz we have no disposal and this helps trap those bits of scrambled egg, etc"
:) Multi-use product
And lovely colors
I have seen these at people's house and they work
I am using them in the sink as food catcher and in tub as hair catchers
I can use it in bathroom sink due to the way the sink bowl is but I could probably remove the knob and just use one these and it would probably work just as well there
You get few different colors so it's to put them in all tubs and sinks
"They're pretty wide and have these ridges on them that makes it easy to catch hair, spaghetti etc"
These collect the hair really well and are easy to clean off
"They are large, so they would cover lots of different size drains"
I wish they had a bit of suction
My only complaint is that the force of the water pushes it off the drain when you first turn on the tub faucet
Colors were pretty true to the photos on the listing
My hair sheds so much and the drain clogs all the time
This saved my life
"Easy to use, easy to clean, catches all my hairs in the shower drain, it stays flat in my shower and does not move"
Price is reasonable
I'm soo happy with this product
There will be no more clogging in my shower
This hair catcher was effective for our drain
It was a little bigger than I thought it would be but it still covers the drain once the shower is engaged
I honestly wasn't expecting this to work very well based on the price and the look of it
"Let me tell you, I was so wrong"
This has been a game changer in our household
"I have long, thick hair and this catches so much of my hair every time I shower"
"I hate to think that if I didn't have this product, all of that hair would be going down my drain for my husband to have to fish out later"
This is so worth the money
It Does the job
But no suction power
When you turn the shower on/off it moves and 99% of the hair goes down the drain
So it completely defeats the purpose of even having it
"Well made, great colors, easy to install and easy to clean"
Works like a charm and at a super price
A win-win all the way around
This is a great item to catch hair and prevent clogs
It's also easy to clean and the colors are neutral enough to not take away from the bathroom aesthetic
It doesn't appear to have strong suction but that hasn't been an issue for the shower
Exactly what I wanted
Fast delivery
I have really long hair and lots of it
So when I take a shower or bath hair clogs the drains like crazy
These have eliminated my issues
"Plus I currently do not have a dishwasher so I wash dishes by hand and food always seems to make it in the drain, another issue taken care of"
Works great
Caught the hair perfectly
Just what I was looking for
I have long hair and this will work fine on all my tubs
They are really big
Bigger than I was expected
Good Value for your money
The dimensions didn't really match my bathtub
It's a bit too big but it still does the job
Simple and effective
I am glad to have some backups too just in case
Came as described and works as described
rugged and well built rubber that fit perfectly on my tub
Good deal for the price
Great job on catching loose hairs and preventing them from going down the drain
Perfect fit on the drain
I needed a drain cover for our shower
we tried the tub shroom after reading reviews
It did not allow enough water to pass through and the water was up to my ankles at the end of the shower
I then bought 3 similar products on amazon including these
these are by far the best and you get 5 in different colors
"It catches hair, allows water to pass through and is flexible enough that it shapes to the shower and doesn't allow hair to pass under the sides and down the drain"
Great Product
After I had my baby I started loosing hair so this are great for that
Easy to use and they do the job
It was bigger then I expected
And it didn't work for the sink
Awesome
Gets up all the hair doesn't clog drain
These hair catchers work great
"Since using them I haven't had to use drano or anything on my tub, which I usually have to use fairly often (perks of having long hair)"
It is a great buy and totally prevents hair from draining down the hole and clogging it over time
"From the look of it, I thought it won't work but it proved itself in the first try itself"
Blocked every length of hair from all sides and I could easily even clean it
Great Buy
I only don't know when I will need to replace them to install the next one
I wish they came in smaller quantities
"Works well for what you pay, doesn't really stick, but they're pretty and what I needed"
"This product works well catching hair, but it does not affix to my drain very well and slows the drainage of the water a bit"
"Still, it's workable and will probably save me a call to the plumber down the road"
Good
"Catches hardly any hair in the shower, with or without a mat (under or over the catcher)"
This product is great for preventing hair going down the drain in our shower
After each use I clean it out - very easy
Make sure you dry it out between uses to prevent mold growth
The colors are great
"Like other reviews say, it doesn't stay flat and moves when the water pours down"
"The holes make it really hard for the water to drain so it builds up and makes the catcher float, which literally defeats the purpose of its job"
I enjoyed the quality of these products and the array of colors that came with them
They were perfectly and are easy to use
I purchased this item a few days ago because I moved into a new apartment with a flat screen drain (anyone with long hair knows these are a pain to declog manually)
"I have hair down to my hips and it's very thick, so I bought these hoping I wouldn't have to call a plumber to declog my drain a few weeks down the line"
"To my pleasant surprise, these work wonderfully"
"I used one in the shower last night and this morning, and it caught 100% of the hair strands before they fell into the drain"
"It fits right over the drain and stays there throughout the shower, and cleaning is super simple"
Just lift it back off the drain and carefully remove all the strands of hair
You'll be SO thankful that you have these
Save yourself the pain of draino and plumbers
Amazing simple product
Easy to install easy to remove' Just the thing I was looking for
This product works wonderfully
I have long hair that constantly clogs the drain and this caught it
Ended up saving so much money by not having to constantly buy draino
"love the soft silicone material -- the colors --- the box was cute too -- but, sadly this item is way too large"
"does not fit at all our standard bathtub/ shower drain, nor any of the sinks in our apt"
suction very well
easy and convenient
Multiple included
Great deal for the price
Excellent product quality
I am very satisfied and would purchase again
"Easy to use, stay in place, easy to clean"
"However, water stay bottom of the rim around causing bad odor, slime, and mold"
It was waste of money and I regret buying the product
As expected
The suction power was the greatest but it also doesn't move at all
Bought for my bathtub and it works perfectly to catch the access hair
Excellent product
Catches all the hair in the shower
I also highly recommend it for the kitchen sink
"For those saying it ' floats', you need to position it correctly"
You can't just throw it down on the drain
Make sure it's centered
"These hair catchers are working exactly like I wanted them to, and I like the colors"
They are wider than the standard drain cover
"There isn't any suction, so they tend to slide around a little bit, but it makes for easy clean up"
"Fair warning, the lip won't sit flush with bottom of your tub or shower so it needs to be lifted a bit when you're done so the water will drain"
"Easy to install, they work pretty well, and they're silicone do it'll be really easy to clean"
I've had others in the past that weren't and they were a pain
Worked perfectly
I needed to cut the center out to make room for the drain plug and these still worked very well in catching hair in the shower
Fun colors too
Actually not a bad purchase
The suction is really good and catches all of my hair
Big area to catch hair and let water through
"As long as you don't nudge or move it, it stays and works fine"
These are awesome and actually work
I definitely recommend these to anyone
They catch so much hair
"Nice colors, soft & flexible"
"They slide around a bit (we've got one in our standing shower), but they are good at capturing the hair"
They come in a beautiful box and individually wrapped
"They are huge so they cover the shower drain very well, are easy to clean, and catch alot of hair"
Also works well in a kitchen sink that doesn't have a garbage disposal
Definitely great value for money
This was the best product i have tried so far
It actually works and collect all hair before going down the drain
This hair catcher works as description
I like the small knob which help my hand stay away from dirty residues
I suggest cleaning it weekly to avoid mold buildup
It was easy to install and it works as advertised
It came with extras that we were even able to share them with some friends
I like this
"I have a very old bathtub that has a metal bar sticking out in the middle of the drain, so the regular drain strainers that you use don't fit on my tub"
"I decided to try these and they work, they stay in place pretty good so I never had the issue like the other reviews had where it was floating up"
It doesn't get gross when you clean it and it's really easy
The only downside is that it literally catches everything and gets clogged fast and doesn't drain until you clean it out during a shower
If there is a lot of soap build up it will clog so you gotta clean it each time and shouldn't leave it after a shower
Also if you're really dirty (like my husband who works in a mechanic shop) it will clog during a shower from all the dirt and soap scum
It's a great product
Didn't know this was supposed to have suction
It doesn't
But it does catch hair on a flat drain and it doesn't float away
I'm shedding like crazy after having my baby and my hair is very long and thick and this catches hair really well
My only small complaint is that it slightly creates a puddle and sometimes hair gets caught around the edge instead of in the catcher/mat
I would call my landlord at least once a month to clean out my drains
Not anymore
Works like a dream
Very easy to use and does a great job of catching hair
It does cause a little slower drainage in the shower but otherwise is a great product
Have yet to use the product yet so it's hard to give a solid review
"However, they seem to be staying in place and people have had success in the past"
Good value for the money
2 long haired girls in the house this is desperately needed to prevent clogged drains
Working great so far
"They stay put, don't float around in the shower and are easy to clean off"
"I use one of them in my kitchen sink too, as the stopper that came with the sink isn't very efficient"
These are definitely a better option than hiring a Plummer
This shower drain cover is cost-effective
But maybe more colors will be better
It gets the job done
"Easily adjust, could stay in place better but not a problem"
These hair catchers are exactly what we needed
"These are cheap, yet convenient and do the work very well"
We are using these in both our baths and kitchen sink
It's also very easy to clean
"This thing sucks, tried it in a standard standing shower and bath tub"
"My long hair pools around the outside edges of the disk, the water gets clogged until it reaches the height above the catcher to go down the drain"
I end up having to use my feet to splash/kick up the hair into the spikes
"There's no suction to the floor, very easy to move around with your foot"
"Not worth it, I went and got one from the grocery store which was much better"
It may slide around when you start the shower but I just push it back into place
It does catch the hair
The little nubby bumps manage to grab onto everything
2nd time ordering the 5 pack
Great colors that go with almost anything
"Have one in my shower, and in 2 sinks"
Do not waste your money
Great product
It's a little rubber disc you throw over the drain with some holes in it
It doesn't stick well to the surface and hair still gets under it resulting in a clogged drain
They are huge and don't work well in the sink
It catches some hair but not all
There is no suction in my shower drain
So the product slides some
"However, in our tub shower there is suction and it stays in place well"
Both showers it still catches my hair and I shed a lot
"Works perfectly, easy to clean"
Really glad to not have clogged drains anymore
I love the colors of these and that they are not made from plastic
These are a MUST in my house
Does the job simple but efficient
Great colors
Not too bright but now plain old white or beige
Easy to place and remove for both baths and showers
Very sturdy and the material seems pretty good where it'll last for awhile
The colors seem a little off like very light and muted but I suppose it's better than being too bright
I starting to loose a lot hair after I had the baby
I been looking for something like this for awhile
This really worked to catch the hair and looks pretty too
"So far so good, easy to install in each of our showers"
"No suction, just sits flat on top of the drain"
"Installed one over a square drain, one over an old fashioned drain, and one in the kitchen sink to keep scraps from going down the drain"
this product would be great if it wouldn't move every time i go to rinse something in the sink
What is the point in using it if I have to fight to keep it in place
I will not repurchase
Does it's thing
I love it for my bathroom
Catches hair amazingly
But not my favorite for the kitchen sink
The kitchen sinks I think need the wire mesh one that goes into the sink hole
Food falls into it and it's easier to clean up
"With this one, the food is still in the sink and when the cover moves a bit, food falls into the hole"
"But like I said, it's great for my shower and bathroom sink"
I have a lot of hair and it falls out a lot
My curly hair friend took a shower and it caught EVERYTHING
Works great in our shower to catch my hair since I do shed a lot
Not sure why this comes in a pack of 5 because it is literally useless
As soon as I turn the water on it shifts away from the drain
It does not stay put at all
total waste of money
Very basic sink essential
Its very straighforward and seems to be catching hairs in the tub so its doing its job
I've used these drain covers for a short time and they seem to work great
"They are a little bigger than a CD, so they should cover most drains"
I've had no trouble using these
I see no reason not to try them out at least
Very helpful
I was worried it wouldn't fit my drain but it's big enough to cover just about any drain I suppose
My shower drain keeps getting clogged so I hope this does the trick
I will update my review in a month
I love these hair catchers
The hair catcher came with different color make it look beautiful
Plus it is simple to install
They are perfect in the tub and shower as well
They catch hair and super easy to clean
They are better than the mesh hair strainers
They keep your drains gear free and clog free
Product is very durable
These are great for catching hair or food
I love that it comes in a multi pack and the colors are fun
10/10 would recommend
Works well and does what it's supposed to do
"Good product, worth the money"
Doesn't catch hair and moves around
Absolutely does not stay in place
"Great product, lays over the drain, catches hair, rinses/wipes clean"
Doesn't hurt if you step on it
Product works as it should
No problems with it
very simple design - easy to clean and replace
I've been using this shower drain cover for almost a month and so far it works great
The kit comes with 5 different colours pack so I would assume it could last a long time
"It's easy to clean and remove hair off, but everytime when I turn on the water faucet, the cover would move a little bit because of the running water, so you'll need to move it back"
Overall it's a good buy
"This product is awesome, work well to take care of the long hair in the drain so that I don't have to spend a lot to clean out the drains"
recommended
Works pretty well overall
"If you turn your water on to powerfully, they won't stay in place"
They also float up if a there is a lot of water (like dumping a pan in a sink)
Works awesome and is so easy to clean
"Para nada recomendado, esto es m's coplicado por que no se quede en el lugar"
I love it except that it doesn't suction to the tube
It's cute and colorful but the suction sucks
"You always have to move it around, doesn't stick"
You would have to have the exact right set up to use these
"For our shower with a floor drain, it did not stay in place, the edges were too thick to lie flat, and as a result the hair simply went right underneath it"
"I don't know what drain this would work with, but not ours"
I like the variety of colors and soft silicone material
"They are easy to work with and clean- my only problem is one of my tub drains is a pop up/close style, and this doesn't fit over that properly because it just lays flat"
"They can't stick to the tub floor, floating even for small amount of water"
Waste of money
I wish they should have designed them with some suction
I used one of them and may need to throw away the others
I bought these and put them in every shower and bath tub in the house
My lovely wife and mother in law have long hair and I was constantly having to run drain cleaner every month or two to keep things flowing
I am sure those are not great for the environment not to mention the constant expense
"After I put these in no more issues, just clean these out ever week or so and you are good to go"
If they get "gunky" with soap residue just spray them down with vinegar
"Cute colors didn't quite fit over my bathtub drain, but was able to remove that and will replace it when I need to plug the drain"
these only sit no suction at all and slide when water hits them
the hair gathers around base not the nubs on it
do not recomend
Exactly what I expected
I had one of those SinkShrooms for my bath tub
It worked great at first but later on it got mold at the bottom and impossible to remove
Then I realized I can't use something that goes under the outlet
I've also had the silicon ones that look like a flower with lots of holes around it - these are extremely difficult to clean
"Did some research and realized this might be the best design to fit my needs - to fit snuggly, catch hair, clean easily and no mold potential"
For the price it is so worth it
Strongly recommended
Fit well in our sink and washtub
May not work in a bathtub with a smaller drain
Great product but mine doesnt suction well
i am still very pleased
Colors are great
I am going to purchase more as stocking stuffers
"For the same price as getting just one drain cover on the market, this collection gives you multiple fun color options"
"Easy to use, and super effective"
Easy to install and remove
"Doesn't have a strong auction but lays flat and don't seem to have any trouble with it blocking hair, etc"
A good value
Cool product and give your shower/bath a good style
Using it in my stand up shower
I loved the stickiness/suction quality of this product
"Besides it being very easy to install, it stuck right to the shower drain"
"After the first use, I noticed hair/soap residue on top of the product"
This is exactly what I needed
"Added bonus, cute colors, pricing point, and quantity in package"
Placed one in my RV shower and another in my Master Bathroom
Love have a few spares around too
Well nice quality and arrived very fast
it's really good
easy to install and remove but have very bad suctuion power
I'm really happy I bought these drain hair filters because I'd often have to unclog my hair from the shower drain (which is super gross every time even with the drain snake)
"It does a much better job than any of the drain hair filters I've used in the past, and I don't have to clean out the drains that much (a huge plus)"
"All in all, it's a pretty good product"
"These silicone hair catchers were good, they did just described"
They are easy to clean and reuse
The silicone gives it flexibility to bend and I really liked that
"Also, the color options were nice"
It does the job well and now I am no longer concerned about clogging the drain with my hair
I like the various colors included in the package
Works great
These hair catchers are amazing
I was so tired of taking the cover off the shower drain to clean it out
The hair catchers catch all the loose hair and I just wipe it off
It has made cleaning so much faster and easier
I wish I had bought them a long time ago
Worried that these would be thin and flimsy but they are perfect
Nice and thin so it captures hair really well
Plus all of the nubs leave no chance for hair getting through
The only downside is that the hair can be hard to get out of the trap because it does such a good job trapping it
Worked great to catch hair
Nice colors
Like that there are multiple on one package
I bought this for my bathtub to catch my hair before it went down the drain
It definitely works for that
I did notice that it doesn't suction very well and I have to be mindful to not bump it with my feet when I 'm showering
Our septic tank inspector said we needed to reduce the amount of hair that went down the drain
These were easy to install and work great to keep hair from going down the drain
"I just got these today,  and they instantly started to work later on when taking a shower"
It stops all the hair from going down the shower drain
I highly recommend
"I have a flush, center drain shower stall that I ordered this product for"
"Been trying to find something that won't hurt, bend, or move when showering, basically going to be stepping on it frequently"
I like that this product is soft so it doesn't hurt to step on and doesn't bend out of shape
There is no suction unfortunately
Perhaps because the shower stall is plastic instead of tile or ceramic/etc
"Catches most the hair, so successful purchase"
"I have long hair, my previous hair catcher was very efficacious in catching my discarded hair but it became discolored and weak"
"After purchasing and using these,  they have caught maybe 2-3 strands of hair"
The flow through slits are so wide the hair just slips right through
I would not recommended these at all
Sorry
Easy to clean and the colors are so cute
Very easy to install and works great in my shower
Works very well
Easy to use
Cute colors
I just ordered these because i have long hair that easily clogs the drain
So far i haven't had any issues
Water is still able to get through to drain properly while catching all my hair
"Works great, nice suction, easy to clean"
"Unfortunately, the middle is not high enough for your standard sink drain stopper and there is virtually no 'seal' or 'suction' around the outer edges"
"Received wrong colors,-received box opened it was tampered disappointing but it fits perfect in stand up shower"
I had to cut out center to fit over tub drain plug in second bathroom
ease of use - liked colors
Good value
Stays in place and catches most hair
No complaints
Great product and very economical
Excelente producto
I love that I don't need to fit it to my drain
It stays in place and catches lots of hair
"Does the job, traps most hair"
"Does not stay suctioned over drain, but that's ok"
Easy to use and works well
These silicon hair catchers seem durable and easy to use
"They are all the same size; I thought they came in different sizes, but they do not"
Love it
Lately my hair has been falling a lot and was going crazy whin the drain in the tub
This product has helped catch my hair and keep the drain clean
Love the variety in colors and was even able to use one in the kitchen sink
Great cover for the shower drains
Overall great product
Great price for the amount of drain covers that you get
Kids loved the color selection for their bathroom
Does what it says it will
"Do wish it 'stuck' a little better, but don't know how it could honestly"
Would recommend
It is big enough to fit all kinds of drains
"Pretty good on catching long hair, easy to remove hair from it"
One concern would be it is easy to float away (still covers the drain but not on the center of drain)
Product is very durable and easy to install
Love the different colors
The size of it is great and cover the drainage
Very satisfied with this hair catcher
It's really good
I love it
This is high quality hair catcher
It does a great job catching hair and is larger than the previous one I had bought else where
It is also soft and I don't mind stepping on it
I highly recommend this product
This product was great and very easy to use and clean
Works just like the product description
Great
Just put down and ready to go
Great for keeping that hair from going down the drain
Only used X1 due to water back up
Not enough drainage holes for water to run without major backup on shower floor
This product floats around with running water
They don't work
I'm honestly amazed that I have any hair left on my head
"Every time I shower I shed so much hair, then even more when I brush it"
"I end up having to pull gross stuff out of the drain, which is about as pleasant as it sounds"
"This catches the hair and doesn't let it go down the drain, no more fishing for gross hair snakes"
This is a gift for my friend
She has four girls with long hair 'Put a hair catcher in every tub to avoid clogging the drain
"It has two sides, and the side with the small bump is upward, which can grasp the hair and keep the pipeline unobstructed"
It is easy to clean the things on the top when the water is washed
Super easy to put over the drain and the material does its job perfectly
Not completely sure yet how it's gonna work but willing to give it a go since I lose a lot of hair
Easy to place and remove for both kichen and bath
the material seems pretty good where it'll last for awhile
"The only regret is that the suction power is not enough, sometimes it run"
Inexpensive and catches all the hair
This stopper does not work for my hair size
It only stops a few hair and I have found most clogging my bathtub
It collects things well; however if you dump water on it sideways it does slide out of place easily
Works best for showers
In the sink it collects food particles well as long as you are careful while dumping a lot of water on it
Does it's job & they're great colors
Good product
I haven't used the product but it appears to be made well and fits well on the drain
"I will be taping it down, or adding something sticky to make it stick"
Just throw it on the drain and it stays put
Doesn't suction in place which makes it easy to move if need be
Slows down the flow of water in my shower but so worth it if it fixes the need to go out and buy an abundance of drano every month
Between my shedding shoulder length hair and the 3 cats (2 long hairs) we had to come up with some solution
Did what I needed it to do at a great price
Glad I don't have to dig in my drain for hair anymore
They are easy to clean up
They catch a lot of hair
I have used other plastic or metal drain catchers before and they would sometimes move around or not have a good suction These hair drain catchers did not move once you place them on top of the drain
I like how they have different neutral colors as well
didn't stop hair from going down my sink and didn't let water go down the drain with it
"II truly love the 5 colors of these drain screens, which are muted and very modern"
"They are super easy to use, as well"
You just lay them on top of the existing drain and voila
They catch hair on the small knobs that are all around the rim
Simple and effective
Shipping was fast and packaging was perfect
Doesn't work that well hair still gets in the drain
Good value
Gets hair in trap then you pull it out after shower
Did not like ut
Not what I expected
How can I return it
I originally bought this to work in my bathroom
"For the record, I have a shower, not a bath"
"I still have it in there just in case, but it hasn't really caught anything"
My shower isn't properly angled (the contractors cut a lot of corners when they built our home
"), so that might have something to do with it"
"Anyway, we hate the usual stoppers in the kitchen sink and wanted to try this there"
It works great in the kitchen
The sink one looks clean because we cleaned it
It does actually get all the food and such
My mom also got one and loves it in the kitchen
Highly recommend for kitchen use if you're also tired of those metal stoppers that keep breaking or that you have to angle to prevent water collecting
We loved this product
The colors are so pretty
"Cute, get a lot for the price and does the job"
"Great product; we have an old tub with a broken/missing plug, and we were getting clogs almost weekly"
Bought these in June and have not had an issue since
Such a good buy
We had another hair catcher that was complete trash
This is finally a good one that I know will last us
Also what a great freaking deal to get so many for this price
It doesn't stay in place
It slides off the drain a couple times during my shower
You can see in the picture that it didn't catch any hair in it
"Instead, hair is going underneath the catcher - some hair has already fallen in the drain"
Works great catching hair and keeping it out of the drain
Would recommend
I really like the product
And the material is also good
It holds hair but it doesn't stick to the tub so with heavy water flow it moves from its place
They came so in handy
And can't complain about the beautiful colors
Definitely recommend
"Does the job in catching hair, size is too big but I figured it's to make sure it catches hair before it goes in the drain"
"Didn't really suction too well into the tub, currently have it in showers, kitchen sinks"
My current living situation has me using a bathroom sink without a drain covering
"Last week a whole cosmetic eyeshadow brush fell down into the drain and I needed to use long, needlenose plyers to reach the brush and remove it"
"The fear of losing a ring, earnings, or other jewelry (which I have also had to fish out from the drain) left me searching for a solution"
These coverings work like a charm
"They sit even with the sink and provide enough coverage to not fear losing my items, but also water passes through easily"
"I have yet to see a catch of my hair, but for the purpose I intended to purchase for, I can see this being a tremendous life saver"
"Works very well, no more hair down to the drain"
"My bathroom sink will clog so easy with my long hair, and this hair catcher really got all my hairs out of the drain"
"I love the strong suction of this hair catcher, and all the different colors it comes with"
I mainly bought this product for my shower
Simple and effective product
Comes in different colors
It does it job
It stick In place and catch hair
It is also easy to remove and clean
Just have to keep cleaning it at the end of the weak so no mold will grow
Great product for a great deal
"Pretty, vibrant products"
I love how you get 5 to rotate out or use in multiple bathrooms/kitchens
Have worked well so far
Great product
Works as intended
Easy to install
Very happy with my purchase
I had to clean out my shower drain once a week [and I only wash my hair twice a week
"], but this has saved me from having to do it"
"Amazing product for so cheap, strongly recommend"
Not sure if it has something to do with my tub but it would not adhere at all
Just kept floating away once water began to fill the tub
Waste of money for me
Sorry
"We moved to our new house about one year ago, my wife and my daughter have long hair"
I was looking for drain hair catchers after a couple of months
This product works perfectly
Easy to clean and the colors are cute too
works well for hair
This product came quickly and I really like the style and color
"It looks great in my bathtub, and catches all the hair"
"The five pack is a great deal, and my roommates and I were all able to pick a color that went with our bathroom"
Overall great purchase
"Works great,  and looks nice too"
It works great
I love that it comes with multiple in a package
It definitely does the job and catches anything trying to go down the drain
This is easy to place
I don't say easy to suction because there are no suction cups and no grip
The mat just sits on top of the drain
"It hasn't stopped any hair or fuzz from going down the drain, so I still have to clear the drain every time I shower"
It has collected soap that dried and made the drain even less effective
"Simple, does the job"
"Nice look, assortment of colors"
Good size
Not enough suction for my preference
Sometimes have to reposition it in the bathtub
It catches some hair and some will still go in the drain
I don't recommend this product at all
Why does Amazon pick this thing as its choice product
Was easy to use
Great value for your money
Great product
Easy to use
Great for kitchen and bathroom
Easy to install and no fuss to clean
"very useful, great product, highly recommend"
This is a simple product that works pretty well
I tried it for the bathtub and sink drains
I liked it better in the bathtub drain
It moves around too much on the sink drain
Great price
Cute colors
Big size
Love this product
Living in a house that has a septic tank my hair has always been a problem going down our shower drain
It would always get backed up
This literally catches all my hair
Only con I'd have to say is there isn't any suction so it moves around a little sometimes but easy fix
This product is very effective in preventing the hair from going down the drain
Colors match my house decors
Used it in the sink and the tub
Perfect to catch hair and food particles
Colors were nice and fits over large drain but no suction so doesn't stay over drain
Luckily they were cheap
these are perfect to keep unwanted items out of my new shower drain
The colors are nice and  they look like they belong &lt;3
When I originally looked at these I thought they had suction cups to hold them in place
They don't
"When I first turn on the water they move around, but once the shower is on it overall stays put and does it's job"
I just wish it had suction cups on it
Definitely effective
"My hair is very long, plus I tie it up in a bun every day, so I lose a lot in the shower"
"The catcher caught most, if not all of the loose hair but it is a pain to get the wet hair off of the contraption after your shower"
I would suggest letting the hair dry before trying to remove it from the catcher
Other that I am happy with the product
I'd rather have to clean this than pay a plumber to snake my pipes
That's what she said
I love the colors
I just needed one for the shower but I love that I can match with my shower curtains now
It catches some hair but it doesn't have the suction and doesn't stay in place
Adults in our family don't really do big Xmas gifts but we do contribute to each other's stockings
My mother in law hates tchotchkes so I am always on the hunt for useful items that are also nice to look at to gift to her
Took a gamble on these and I think they worked out pretty well
She is an avid cook and has a pretty weak garbage disposal so we popped one of these in the kitchen sink and it's doing the job pretty well
She does have a garbage disposal but this little device makes it much easier to gather up leftover food waste for composting
It's true there's no suction but gravity and friction do a good job of keeping it in place
They seem pretty sturdy but I'm still glad it comes in a pack of five because if one does get particularly gross you can just toss and replace it
And of course the price can't be beat
Liked the product easy to install and easy to
honestly they are soft plastic and all of them molded after a few weeks and i ended up throwing them all out and buying a metal one
Doesn't sit right over our drain to catch anything
I bought this product and very happy with my selection
The suction is large and covered the drain very well
It catch my long hair well
Happy with the product
Does what you need it to do
Keeps my long hair from going down the drain
and pretty easy to clean
"I did like the stopper drain cover, but I do wish it had the ability to suction to the sink a little better"
Easy to use and clean
"Good overall, does the job"
Can become more fine to catch more hair
It actually works
We've tried other solutions but they didn't really work that well
This product simply gets the job done
There are three women living under one roof
Imagine the hair build up in the drain
These drain covers help to capture the hair and prevent hair build up
I like how there are 5 in pack
Good colors too
doesn't fit well on my bathtub but does the job
I wish it would sit lower in the drain
but it seems to be doing the trick
Seems to work as expected
It didn't stick on the shower floor very well
"I haven't used it yet, so I'm not sure how well it will stay over the drain with the water running"
"It only fits one of my drains, so I was kind of bummed about that"
You have to have a very specific type of drain
"Terrible, No Suction,  constantly lifts once water hits it"
Terrible
Stuff also falls through the cracks
If I could give it zero stars I would
The first thing I noticed as I received my order of Gotega Hair Catcher is that these are really colorful as the name suggests
"Which is perfect for different sinks, bathtubs, and drain coverings of different shape and sizes"
These fit perfectly and very easy to install and remove when needed
This is a tremendous lifesaver and works like a charm for the purpose it's intended :) I'm very happy and highly recommend the product
Like just pulling hair from this rather than waiting for my shower to get clogged
Works very well
It works really well to catch both long and short hair from going into the drain
Saves us from having to get draino every month
Works well
Catches all the hair
It doesn't suction to the tub very well but it still works as intended
Easy to install and works great to prevent hair from entering the drain
These are not what I needed
They don't stay in place or catch anything
We love how easy these are to clean compared to a metal drain stopper
Overall recommend to anyone looking to protect drain from being clogged by hair
This worked just like I needed it to
Fits easily into any drain and keeps the hair out of the drain and from causing clogs
"Soft material, no need to worry about stepping on and break it"
Stay at the place
Catch everything
Easy to clean
No over flow
Will recommend it to friends and family
"Overall pretty useful, catches hair well"
"Some smaller pieces of hair still get through though, but it is what it is"
I like the quality good product and 5 different color
I needed to replace what I currently have which is a hair catch made out metal
Silicone material is so much better
"Easy to manage and keep clean, and it works just as described"
"It's going to take me a long time to use up all 5 in this package, because the quality seems very durable and will last a long time"
Didn't work how I was expecting
Seems like a great product
Will see how it holds up
Easily covered the drain plugs in my bathtub and worked for the Sinks as well
Does a good job catching the hair
good value
Did not catch anything
It moves so easily
"The second water or anything hits it, it moves, letting everything go down the drain"
Stopped using it after a few days
Waste of money
This product is great for my bathtub floor
"It doesn't slip or move around the tub, but it picks up easy when it is time to clean it"
It catches all my hair and I no longer have to use Drano twice a month
I love this
"No more having to pick out gross hair from the drain, this makes it very easy :)"
"comes in a 5pack, and variety of colors"
I have one in each bath sinkand each tub
works great
Affordable and easy to install
Love that it comes with several in a pack
Won't stay in place so it doesn't do its job
Gets the job done
Been looking for a flat design like this
Works great and looks really nice
5 pack different colour good use
These are so simple yet genius
These little stuff preventing your hair from going down the drain but also very easy to clean the hair from the actual catcher itself
Really works
I used this hair catcher for my shower drain
"It did not have any suction to it really, but I liked how big it is"
It could cover almost any size drain
I also liked the fun colors and was able to match them to the different colors in each bathroom
I only gave it four stars for now because I have not used it long enough to determine if there are any issues with it
Nice fit
Made well
Good suction
So far I am pleased with this product
"Nice colors as well, good quantity and quality for the money"
Would purchase this product again
Catches hair so it doesn't go down the drain
If the water pressure directly hitting it is too powerful it moves a little from the force of the water
Otherwise it works well when the shower is on
Love it
Would recommend
Love it
Very easy product to use that does the job
I like everything about this product
Easy to use and serves its purpose
"Catches all the hair, but does not stick to the tub effectively"
It still slides around a lot when showering
Simply put
they are worthless
"They are too thick, hair simply does not get trapped in it"
They were great for my kitchen sink but my bathroom sink they didnt fit
"In my household, there are five women with long hair"
The drain gets clogged frequently
This is definitely a lifesaver
Easy to clean and the colors are cute too
There is no suction on them
They don't stay on the drain at all
They all don't catch any hair
No stars
Overall ok product but doesn't stick to water outlet
"There's no suction power at all, hair still goes down the drain"
Needed something to stop hair from going into the septic tank from the shower and this works great
Easy to use
These work fantastic for the tub drain as well as the kitchen sink
Universal size and they are easy to use
These are perfect for catching her in the bath tub
"I've read other comments that it floats away, but thankfully, my bathtub is shaped so that the edge of the catcher hits the edge of the bathtub, so floating away is not an issue for me"
"Takes less than a second to slap it on, and very easy to remove (versus the metal hair catchers that sometimes are hard to pry out)"
I love the assortment of colors
"They're fun, but not overly bright or childish"
"That said, these drain covers offer ZERO suction, so I would not recommend them for kitchen sinks, as food and dishes will just knock it away"
It also does not work for my bathroom sink because it's not flat
Knocked off a star for it not being more universal and for the lack of suction
You put it there and after some days you see your hair on top
"It's easy to remove, besides, it got 5 of them in the package"
"It a good one for the bathroom sink, good kitchen, and bath"
it will definitely save you for having a Plumbing bill
I like it
The colors are beautiful
We are constantly having to unclog our drain so I'm glad to have something to keep our drain free from our hair
Way not worth the money or your time
For this to cover a flat drain in my shower to collect long hair that me and my daughter continously shed
The thing floats in anything over a 1/4th in water and after a week it hasnt collected a single hair and I think it allowes the hair to just flow under it
I hate to waste even my time to take it to the ups store but this place isn't getting 10 bucks from me for a useless product
Covers my drain well but no suction power so hair can still go underneath the cover :(
These come in fun colors and work great
Our shower drain sees a lot of hair and now we aren't going to get clogs
It's good
I was so excited about these hair catchers as I have 3 full baths and a house full of girls
We have been using them for several weeks and have yet to catch the first hair
The only thing these hair catchers seem to grab hold of is mold
Great product and assortment of colors
It's completely useless
"I should have returned it immediately, but I missed my chance and now I am stuck with it"
"Great product, true to description"
Super easy to install and clean
"Works well, as advertised"
"Mine didn't come with suction, but doesn't matter because it doesn't fit over my drain lifter"
I'm going to attempt to make a small hole so I can put the drain lifter through it and hopefully it work
Product works well and is easy to use and install
"Genial,La calidad es muy buena y f'cil de instalarlaLos colores muy bonitos"
I gave it five stars for easy to remove
water moves it
I don't understand why it asked about suction power
That implies there should be some suction power
It doesn't
TotalWaste of money
"I had something similar that was perfect, but after 20 years it's gotten ugly"
I guess I'll go back to trying to find one closer to the old one
It really was perfect
Clear
5 suction cups
These are just useless
"Product is durable, but arrived defomed and would not lay flat"
So hair could bypass the catcher and slide under
Does not serve its purpose
"Easy to use, fits correctly and catches things  perfectly"
"I like the colors and design, but there is no suction at all and it just lays on top of the drain with gaps on the sides"
I don't think it will stop hair from going down the drain
Will probably return
Love this product
Great quality
Does not stay suctioned over drain
Great quality and value for the pack
Protects the shower drain for hair etc
"Does a very good job, easy to install and clean, and looks pretty"
Love the colors
Very pretty drain cover
It's a lot bigger than I thought it would be
It was an amazing product
It worked like a charm
I was so happy when I received the package
It is an amazing product and I would refer it to anyone
"This thing slides around in the bathtub and even when it stays put, the hair slides under it into the drain"
It doesn't really catch any hair
The holes in the middle are also too large to trap grit
"So, it's going into the garbage"
The trouble is you can't return a product like this because you only discover how bad it is after you've used it
Amazing product
I was tired of unclogging my shower drain
This product did the trick
Really like product
Easy to clean
Helps the drain run smoothly and keeps hair from my septic
did not collect 1 single hair
I gave the extras away and no one like them with the same complaint
Seems like the holes are too big or just not right
We bought the TubShroom and it is working great for collecting hair
I bought these to catch hair in the shower and was so thrilled when I saw there were at least 5 in the package
So I put one in my sink as well
These were a great price especially with getting multiple in the package
Loved the variety of colors
The suction was good too when the water ran and i found hair following a shower
Very good will buy again
Multiple came in the package
Easy to clean
Worth it
Works as expected
They floated around the tub
They did not stay over the drain
Had to return it after trying it for a week
"refused to stay over the drain, and very uncomfortable to step on"
It moves around
I tested one using my kitchen sink and I'm impressed
The water keeps it down and I don't have to worry about it rusting like the metal one that I previously lost
It is a decent size and the colors are nice
I even have enough to share with my two sisters
Yaaay
Exactly as described
"Large enough to catch hair going down the drain, easy to use, and very fast shipping"
I lose a lot of hair with every wash and these help keep the drains free of large clumps of hair every day
This product is way to good as compared to its price
You get 5 of these just with 10 dollars and even one of them can last years
Great product and good quality material
Highly recommend this item
Fast delivery
Worth the price
This product works well but it's almost like it needs to be flipped upside down from how the pictures indicate use
"When the little nubs are pointed up, it actually restricts the water from flowing down the drain"
"If you flip it over and have the nubs pointed down, the water flows to the drain as normal and it still catches hair"
We have determined using it nub down works the best for us
"Either way, I am happy with the product but suggest using it as I indicated"
It's really nice
I like all the colors and it does a good job of catching the hairs
It's pretty simple to put on and take off
It's also thin so never gets in the way
These are wonderful
They work great and look nice also
Very satisfied with my purchase
This product works great for stopping hair and I love the colors too
It doesn't stay in place and doesn't catch anything
Don't waste your money of these
"Others have been too big, but these fit in the bathroom sink to keep hair and toothbrushing debris form going into the drain"
Works perfectly
Great at preventing my curly thick hair from clogging the drain
Much much much needed hair catcher
"I have long hair, it reaches down to my waist not only that after my son I started to lose a lot of hair m"
It was so bad we had a plumber come out twice in a couple months to unclog my hair from the drain
"We have a stainless steel drain but the hair slips right through it, I needed something of smaller holes to catch my hair"
This was inexpensive and had 4
"In case one gets dirty or breaks I have back upQuality is nice, it's large enough to fit over our stand up shower drain"
It suctions itself to the tiles fine
"Ive been using this for few months and I'm still on my first one, I literally watch my hair build up on this while I shower, in disbelief I lost that much"
also surprised this hair catcher caught that much
"It's easy to keep clean, after I clean the hair off I use a clothes line clip and pin it to a string I tied on shower curtain rod and just leave it there to dry"
very simple
I am very satisfied and so is my husband cause we've stopped having to spend money on a plumber
They are a little hard to clean
But better than a clogged drain
So far so good
This item is no good
It just slides all around the shower and the hair goes right down the drain
"It was easy to use, easy to clean, and it catches all the stuff you don't want going down the drain"
Works nice for stand up shower
Easy to take off and clean
This product is horrible
All of my shoulder length fine hair floats under this
The drain has already clogged
Back to the tub shrooms
Hard to get all the hair out of it
They came quickly and nicely packaged
Would prefer less plastic packaging (more sustainable packaging) Work great and I think this buy was worth it
Perfect for the job
Just what I needed
A cute way to help with the never ending hair from our gorgeous female heads and keep it from clogging the drain
I've only used one of the catchers in the shower once but I was immediately impressed because I was worried that it wouldn't be big enough for my drain
And it caught the lint from my socks so that's great
I will be back in a while with an update as to whether it is catching my hair
Easy to use and install
I have very long hair and this has done a great job of keeping it out of the pipes
I have really long hair and it constantly clogs my shower drain
These work perfect and they don't get super gross since it just covers the top of the drain and doesn't go inside of it
"the stopper's suction power isnt that great, but they don't move very easily either"
"overall, I'm happy"
they definitely stop my long hair from going down the shower drain
"they're stylish, too"
Great product and easy to use
"Great value, and good quality, you get 5 which is great A+++++"
Love this hair catcher
No more clogged drained
Too soon to tell
No suction cups to hold in ace but seems to stay fine on our standing shower
"Great quality, works well and I love all the colors"
Does not collect hair and falls in the drain
"After reading all of the positive reviews, I was expecting this product to do its job"
"After one shower, I checked it, and there was no hair trapped at all"
I wanted it to work so badly that I gave it three more chances
Still nothing
I could see that the product didn't form a suction with the tub so hairs were slipping through around the edges
I guess it just wasn't compatible with our tub
Just received our package and installed
"Ring keeps slipping off my finger in the shower recently, so really needed this"
I was skeptical about the suction since you just place the product on your drain--the product did what it was supposed to and I could easily discard the caugh hair
"I liked the design of these stoppers and it stayed in place in my shower as long as I didn't move it with my foot, but I have hair longer than my shoulders, I used it for over a week and I only saw a few hairs stuck underneath it when I picked it up"
There were no hairs on top in the teeth
My last hair catcher had to be cleaned every 2 days
This does not work
It's working as expected
I put it at the bathtub outlet to effectively block the hair from falling in
"I also put it at thekitch sink, the effect is very good"
These are just what our shower needed
My girlfriend has long hair that falls out in the shower constantly and I can already see how much hair is being caught
It's also great because these fit on almost any drain and are super easy to clean
Perfect for a shower used by an adult
This perfectly captures my long hair and is so easy to clean
I throw it in the dishwasher
I can see a kid moving it around and it would not work out
Arrived as promised
Product is as described
There is a bit of an odor but that does fade
This is a lifesaver in my shower
I have some hirsute housemates when it comes to losing hair in the shower
"I've tried everything to make sure the drain does not get clogged, because often the chemicals don't work to dislodge the blockage"
"And, besides, who wants to have that stuff around"
"Next step is to call a plumber, and who can afford that"
"This little drain cover sits, stays, and protects--just like a good dog"
All you have to do is wipe it off with paper towel after a shower and put it back over the drain
I love it
great product
Did not like because there is no suction
it just lays on top of drain
Great product
I loved the look of the hair catchers
They were cute but also super functional
Even caught some grass from my kiddos after they played outside
Love the colors and the price
These were exactly as they were described thank you
I shed hair so much
I have hair down to my butt and it drives my boyfriend crazy
I finally found this online and bought it
I love it
"I clean it out after every shower, and it's simple to just be put right back"
my girl Ivy takes a long time in showering herself
she takes a long time in drying her hair too
"Every now and then, say twice a month, the bathtub filter is jammed, though not as often as the kitchen sink"
"The hair catcher is a good maid, as faithful as a wine bottle cap"
"First and foremost, it stops Ivy's hair from flowing through the drain"
"The sink, upon closer observation, is removed from greasy debris"
"This works good ,it catch a lot of hair and easy to pull the hair off"
It stays mostly in place
Not really effect on drainage
Cute AND effective
Totally recommend
"The quality is good and  The price is nice ,  Especially for the family has lot of lady's"
",  I use this for my every bathroom tub , it work so good"
With two girls in the house these seemed like a good idea to stop hair going down the shower and sink drains
but in practice they just don't work well
They're too large to fit in sinks and in the showers they don't allow water to drain completely
They also will float up if too much standing water accumulates
These hair catchers do not stick to the tub (stay in place) and do not catch hair
It was perfect for what I needed
My tub doesn't have any sort of plug on it so anything small enough would disappear
Do recommend
I love it my tub kept clogging up because of all my PP hair loss but this has helped me soooo much
"I did not like this product, it doesn't adhere to the tub and all hairs go thru easily"
It only catches some but for the most part it doesn't work
Very easy to use and helpful from keeping anything out of the drain
Great product and highly recommend to others
Great price too
Pretty colors and functional
It does move at times when water is on it full force
Does job of keeping hair out of drains but
P suction
Moves around like crazy
"After just a couple weeks of use, and picking up/drying/cleaning off, there is mildew/mold under it/stuck inside it"
"Yes, I did use cleaner"
"Yes, I did let it dry after cleaning it off and let it dry after the shower"
There was no residue on the shower itself so I'm not sure why it did this otherwise
I cannot get the mildew/mold out of it and am now down to 4
I might be looking for another option
"Neat colors and work well for catching debris, food, hair etc"
Quite large but work
They don't suction at all
So it ends up sliding all of the place
super easy to install and clean up
These are a bit heavier so they stay well
The lack of suction pieces means that they are easier to clean
Seems to work well
The holes may be a little large
Perfect for catching shower hair
Comes in beautiful colors and can also be used in the kitchen sink for catching leftover food when rinsing plates and doing dishes
It's good quality
Works great
I bought these because they are attractive and look like they would work
"But unfortunately, they don't work very well"
The hair just goes underneath it into the drain or the hair goes through the slots that are too big
I tried doubling them and it works a little better
Been shopping around for a shower drain to catch all the hair
I have such long thick hair and this product really makes it soo much easier
Great price for come in like a pack of five
Just wonderful
Much needed for my shower
5 thumbs up
Does what it's supposed to for a great price
"These are well made and very pretty, but didn't stay put in my tub/shower drain"
"As a little water pooled by the drain, this product floated atop the water, thus rendering it unable to stop any hair from entering the drain"
I had to return them and buy one with the sunken center that fits into the drain hole
"Suctions on the bottom would be great, but it catches what is needing to be caught"
Works great
I was shocked at how much hair I was losing and was going down my drain
This little gadget caught all of it
It comes with 5 of them so I had extra to give to family and friends
Just no
Didn't suction to bottom and therefore some hair went down the drain
It does catch some of the hair
Does what it is suppose to do well
"Useful for kitchen sinks, bathtubs, and most other drains"
Durable material and easy to clean
Good size too
Works wonderfully for our garbage disposal cover
"It broke, and needed a quick fix"
I love the bright colors of this drain cover
I have one in my tub drain to catch hair and one in my kitchen sink to catch food
It does the job and it makes my bathtub and sink look more cheerful
"This really helps catch all the hairs our family might shed, and it comes with 5 so if one doesnt work anymore you always have one ready for replacement"
Great product
"They look good, are easy to use, and work super well at catching hair and things"
perfect buy
"i use to have to buy drano for my shower all the time but now i don't have to anymore, it doesn't miss a single hair it's easy to clean and the pack has beautiful colors"
i highly recommend if you constantly have to clean loose hairs out of your shower drain
"I like the color selection, the coverage it gives you over the drain, and how well it helps with keeping hair from clogging the drain"
Waist of money doesn't even stay down once u turn on the shower it moves terrible and hard to clean
perfect for our drain in the middle of the shower
when our hair would get caught in the drain holes it was impossible to pull out  but now i just pop one of these on the drain and pull the hair off after every use
so happy to find a solution to that yucky problem
I was using one of the rubber products and then steel product as hair catcher for my shower stall but there was no suction to it
It moved all over the place
This one has some weight to it and it kind of glues to the tiles
It doesn't have any suction mechanism but silicon itself is good enough to hold the catcher at it's place
It doesn't move due to water pressure
Surprisingly it works on sink as well
It's very easy to clean and definitely worth the money
Very impressed with this product
They work well and come in several colors
"Fast shipping, cute colors, and easy to use"
The size work great for shower
Worth the price
"I have a husky and since the virus shut down the pet wash stations, we are bathing at home and WOW, this thing WORKS"
THANK YOU
Very simple and the colors are nice
Overall good product
"Doesn't suction as much as expected, but does the job"
Really enjoy this in the shower to catch all the hair I lose
"Love these hair catchers, fits well, suction good, love the color choices and the size of the product"
Some I have bought were very stiff and didn't stay in place
Product is made well
Would recommend
"I purchased these for our shower/tubs, but they did not fit the drain because of their low profile"
Bummed that I had to return them
Catches all my long hair
Boyfriend no longer complains about a clogged drain
"I brought this hair catcher to replace my old one in bath tub, it works very well and it stays in place, worth my money"
"After having to snake the drain and use drain cleaner for the millionth time, finally decided to get a hair catcher and idk why i didn't get one sooner"
"The silicone material keeps it in place and the entire package of 5 was cheap enough that if it gets gross or rips, it's not a big deal to replace"
You can definitely top rack this in the dishwasher to clean as well
I just place it over the drain and it actually catches my long hair
Had tried others before but them didn't fit or stay in place
"My old hair catcher broke, and this does the job, and I was able to get 5 of them for a great price"
doesn't work - floats up the second water touches it
i've had to buy draino already in the time that i've bought this
awwwwful
"Delivered the next day, looks pretty"
"However, it won't stay under the faucet, on my bathtub"
It bothers if it does work
Great for the price and quantity
Received last week
"Colors are very nice, fits perfect on top of built in shower drain, and does catches hair"
On first use I Immediately noticed that as the soap suds accumulated around the drain the water began to puddle
I had to slightly slide the drain cover over to get the water to drain
My solution when showering and not washing my hair is to move it from the drain
"When washing my hair, keep a slight opening for water to drain"
I rated as a 3 because of what I have to
Its helpful with keeping drains clear but would like better suction
Did not catch hair
This product did everything the description said
Just wish it was easier to remove the hair attached to the stopper
They fit perfectly and work way better than expected
Awesome product
I don't see it doing the job unless it's a large object
"Excellant product, would recommend to friends"
Works great
Highly recommend
"It is effective in collecting hair, however never stays in place"
My shower drain is impossible to unclog and gets clogged by my hair so easily- these drain covers were the perfect solution
"It catches all of the hair and never slips out of place, and is super easy to clean"
Love that it's silicone and love the size that completely covers/surrounds the drain
Would definitely recommend
Stays in place
Water still drains easily but catches all my hair so it doesn't clog the drain
Easy to remove hair and clean
This is a very efficient product at a great price
Highly recommended
Works like a charm for flat drains
"I have thick, curly hair that reaches my lower back when dry"
The cover over my shower drain broke off awhile ago and that was the only thing the would save the drain from needing to be cleared once a month
I knew I needed a cover for the drain when the tub portion of the shower would fill with standing water just within the time it took the water to hear up
I have had the product for two months and it works well
It catches 95% of my hair and is easy to remove and clean
I will be saving some money in drain cleaner
The colors are cute too
These work great
Super pleased with how it stays put on top of the drain
I lose a ton of hair when showering and this catches it all
The added bonus of this pack is that I can use one in each bathroom plus take one with me when traveling
Very nice
A lot of bang for my buck
It works very well to catch hair in the shower
I've had it for a couple of months now
Only used one out of the set
I have no complaint whatsoever
Product is great
It stays in place
Water stilldrains and catches all my hair
"Good product to catch hair, but does cause the water to pool in the shower because the water can't get through easily"
Easy to install and looks pretty
Value for money
It stuck all the mess in sink and helps not to clog sink pipe
Easy to use and clean
Love it
These don't catch my hair from going in the drain
I wanted to love them for the quantity and price
But they're not good at suction
Maybe I'll try again
Quick delivery and easy to install and use
Good use
Works well as intended
I was having trouble with the hair clogs and this was the perfect solution
"This is probably the worst thing I've ever purchased, there's no suction whatsoever"
It doesn't actually catch the hair it just makes it string from the catch and down the drain
"So not only do I have to basically gather and pull everything out of the drain just like before, but I also have to untangle the sud soaked hairs fromThe plastic this thing is made out of"
Just received the item and can't wait to use it
Good book
Perfect size
Does the job
Creates perfect seal and successfully keeps small and large debris out of drain
Incredible price for a great quality product
Will purchase again
I liked these at first but they tend to slip around alot
I wish they had better suction power but they are pretty thin
"They are cute and come in a variety of colors and do catch the hair before it goes down the drain, but unfortunately they just don't stay in place"
Works great
"I really like these drain stoppers because they are quite flat and don't take up much room, but do a great job of stopping large things from getting down the drain and my long hair"
I put each one in every room bath tube and drains
I'm glad to have them
Great hair catcher
It was a little confusing for install because I was thinking it would suction to the drain but it just lays on top
Obviously the water doesn't drain as fast but it caught the hair and I haven't seen any issues yet
"This is what I was needing, was worried it would ""float"" away like others claimed, but it was exactly what I needed to capture the hair before becoming a bad clog"
Thanks
I love that it came with so many different colors and that it was incredibly easy to "install" (air quotes added because it's not really a matter of installing - more like just plopping it on top of the drain; it's big enough to cover any size
This product does nothing to catch hair
I have used it in our tub for 5 days and no hair has been on it
It also has no suction to the tub
I am very pleased with this product and the amount they come with
A little bigger than my hand which was a surprise to me in a great way
Use in shower and kitchen sink
Collects hair well
Does the job and very colorful
It works
Only used it once I will make another review when I have had it for a month
However so far so good
Great product
Hair catcher is exactly what I needed in my shower as I have long hair an do not want to clog the drain
Colors are nice and looks good in the shower
It's just a simple hair catchers that you put on top of the drain in your bath tub
It'll catch the hair so the drain won't be clogged by hair
Great product at bargain price
I wish I had found this sooner
It works exactly as advertised
I loved this product
It was exactly what I was looking for and needed
I recommend it 100%
Great for kitchen sink and bath drain
The color options are neutral so they don't stand out
Too big for bathroom sink but work well for bath drain and kitchen
I like the colors and quality of the silicone
Nice packaging that's recyclable too
This works great at preventing hair from going down the drain
"It's pretty difficult to clean as all the hair gets tangled in it, so i find myself grabbing a new one instead of wasting my time"
Does a good job keeping hair out of the drain
"I wouldn't say it does a good job of suctioning to the floor/drain, but it does stop the hair from going down the drain"
Great and simple product that serves its purpose perfectly
Catches all the hair in the shower and is saving my drain from nasty clogs
Love all the colors it comes in too
Highly recommend
I want to love this product and it's so pretty
But they won't suction to my tub and the hair just goes right underneath it
I'm very bummed
Great value for bathroom drain covers
Just put it on the drain and it catches things like hairs
It's much less expensive than similar products
It can be used frequently on all kinds of drains
Amazing
Love this product
Great for avoiding clogs
"Very durable looks like it will last for years, easy to remove and clean"
simple solution
Bigger than I thought but great product
I was really excited about these and opened them up to use immediately
They were still warm from being in the mail
"Honestly, I am super disappointed"
They came wrapped in a piece of plastic which allowed them to get twisted up at some point whether on the shelves or during shipping
Anyway now they are basically useless they don't sit flat so everything goes underneath them
"I tried running hot water over them thinking it would help mold them to the sink and I've left them in for a few days now hoping they would eventually form to the sink, NOPE"
This is a great product
Gets the job done well enough
"Doesn't suction much, but I personally didn't need suction"
Easy to work with
It fits juts right to the drain collecting all the hair
"They fit well over my tub drain and so far, it's caught the hair that usually gets stuck in the actual drain"
I like that they're flexible and pliable
"I wish it suctioned you the bottom of the tub, however"
It moves easily
I don't see any difference with using these
They really don't seem to work at all
I'm very disappointed
Happy that this came with many hair catchers so that I don't have to buy anymore for a while
Great price and fun colors
"very good in quality, and the price is  ok, very useful to stop my hair into tub"
Great
I have used this product in the bath to stop my hair from clogging up the drain
I've only had it for a day but it seems to be good quality and size
"These seem to be pretty secure and don't move as much as the other hair catchers I've used before, though I currently have a drain with a removable plug"
Not sure this product would work well with other types of drains with the plug screwed on since it may not be flush with the surface of the tub which would let hair through
I will update my review to 5 stars once I've used the product for a longer time in my shower and can see how effective it is at keeping my drains unclogged
"It's a simple inexpensive bathtub hair catcher that does the job, and allows water to drain without any issue"
Works way better than expected
Works as intended
Just set and forget
Great quality and easy to keep clean
They look great but do not work
They float away and defeat the purpose
Very disappointed
I like the beautiful colors but it does not stay in place all the time
It floats with the water as it doesn't have anything to stable itself on the sink
Great price and do their job well
"I use these in my studio apartment shower drain for hair catching, and I'm really happy with the product so far"
Fits great on the drain and stays in place until I want to remove it to clean
Would recommend
Works great
Bigger than expected but that's a good thing
Have not used yet but put into place and looks great
Arrived quickly and is good quality
"Great, did exactly what I needed it to"
Loved the quantity for the price
"Great product, easy to use"
Works great for catching hair
This is my first use and it caught every hair
Only thing is it's moved pretty easily so you have to be careful not to kick it or have too much water hit directly on it and it will stay put
"The size of my shower drain is just slightly smaller than the Hair Stopper, but it works pretty good"
"It catches hair easily, and it's easy to clean"
The edge of the Hair Stopper lies flat so hair doesn't get pass it
Good product
I normally have to snake my drain once a week because of my hair that falls out
I haven't had to snake my drain since I got these covers because they prevent the problem
"it does not sitting on where it should be, not recommended"
Does not capture hair well at all
Great product
I got it because I'm moving off to college and will be sharing a dorm with 4 other girls and it works great
even arrived earlier than expected
Easy to install and actually works
"I thought hair would just sneak under, but the product does a great job of catching everything"
And super affordable
Won't rust and easy to put on great material
I thought this hair catcher would resolve our problem with drain clogging occasionally
"However, this does not have suction power to stay in place"
I included the picture to show what I mean
It constantly displaces from it's position when the water is running
"Plus, the holes are big enough that I don't have the confidence in it"
My wife and I used it for couple of days and didn't see any benefit yet
If something changes in a week then I'll post an update
"Otherwise, I'll be returning this and buy something that show results"
I just used one of these to wash my hair the other day
It was very easy to install and didn't have nearly as much mess as other hair catching tools
It doesn't really suction to the sink but that is also not a problem because it stays in place one you out it over the drain
Love it
Easy to add and clean the hair out of
Fast delivery
Same as pictured
Great value
fits fine in my little tub
my tub is naturally curved towards the hole so I didn't have any issue with fitting the cover - there might be issues with the suction power if not for this slight curve
Fits perfectly over my drain
Good quality
"As a hair trap for my tub, it is effective"
"It could have more suction, so I gave it 4 out of 5 stars"
Great product
Works as expected
The thing I like the most about the drain covers is that they work perfectly on all of my drains no matter what the size they are
I used it for my bathtub and it works perfectly
The center holes can catch smaller debris and the bigger slots catch the bigger debris like hair and food
Great product
Saves Money
"Only had the product for a week but catches all the hair, including pet hair"
"There is not a lot of suction to the tub itself so when the faucet is turned on, the water does cause the hair stopper to shift but that is easily fixed once shower head portion is turned on"
"Otherwise, this is currently working and I have no complaints"
"Great price, good product"
Daughter and I have long hair
Tried this out last night and majority of our hair went down the drain
"If your bath water streams goes directly onto your drain, this wont be effective"
When I open the water the bath stream moves the product to where it doesn't cover the drain
It also seems like hair can easily can trapped under it even when I reposition the product after turning on the shower since the suction power is not strong
I'll try the others on the kitchen sink since it seems like these might function better for sink use
I love these things
Its even better because you get 5 in a pack
They catch all the stuff that clogs my drains in both the kitchen and the bathroom
The colours are kind of ugly and faded but they do the job - prevents hair from going down the drain and clogging it
Good price to get several since from previous experience I find they need to be replaced over time as they get soap residue stuck to them
It's great to use in the shower or the kitchen sink
These are easily "installed" and do a great job at catching anything and everything that could potentially clog up the sink
Definitely will be picking up another pack in the future
The product works as expected
It doesn't stick as well in my utility sink where the surface is not smooth - but again that was not surprising
the colors are nice
This product works really well
"It picks up all the hair in the shower, thin and thick"
Colors are a nice additional touch
To catch hairs
"I used many different types, but this is the best"
Works well with trapping the hair and it is easy to clean
Just wish there was a bit more suction to it
But that could just be the way my shower tile is laid out
Overall pleased
Simple and easy
This product has worked out better than others I had
"Water drains well, no clogging"
It "attaches" the floor surface well enough
So far so good
The product is exactly as shown in the pictures
"The product box was a little banged up inside the bigger amazon box, but all 5 pieces were in perfect shape and looked the same as pictured, including the 5 different colors"
"This is easy to install/remove, and just lays flat without suction"
"So far, so good"
I like the way that it looks and it seems to catch a hair
It actually fits well n drain pretty well
"it is pretty but doesn,t stop hair"
This product has excellent function and great style
Absolutely love all of the colors and the large size which fits all drain sizes
"I already used it once, collects all my Long thick hair"
Good
Great for people with long hair
Works great
Highly recommended
Was good
Really just doesn't work
It's annoying
Good product and reasonable price
It was a little larger than I was anticipating but still fit well over the drain in my shower and doesn't move out of place when water is running
I am so happy with this  product
the size of this product is perfect for any drain and it works so well
the colors are cute too
Just received these and so far they are exactly what I needed
"We had to purchase a snake dude to all of my hair continuously going down the drain and building up, no matter how much I tried to prevent it"
This came with 5 so I should be set for a while
Love this product
Enough to cover all of our essentials drains in the house
We will definitely suggest this product to our friends
Does what it advertises -  catches hair before it goes down your drain
"It did the job, I like all of the colors"
Great immediate fix for a drain that gets clogged often
Super helpful and comes in fun colors
"They keep sliding off drain, work ok while no direct water from faucet"
So far so good
"These are meant for flat shower drains only, so they do slide if you push them aside"
A possible improvement would be to mold the product with a nub or two on the bottom that could slip into the drain holes to help prevent it from sliding under minimal force
"In my experience the drain cover did not slide around just from the force of water on the shower floor, nor did it float away as others have claimed"
Due to the thickness of the product a small amount of water will collect around the edges up until it can flow through the hair catching nubs
It is soft enough that you can step on it and experience minimal discomfort
I use this to catch the long hairs of my significant other as well as the short hairs of our dog and it meets expectations for both
too light weight and water draining moves it off the drain
Use for a shower drain in an older house to keep the pipes from clogging
"This was easy to install but in order to fit over the tub stopper, I had to rib a whole in the top"
The suction wasn't as powerful as I needed it to be and on hair wash day ( a day that I'm afraid of because I know I'll clog the tub or sink) unfortunately I saw a good amount of my curly hair slip under the product
The hair that it did catch wasn't an easy clean but I was happy to see that some hair was caught with the hair stopper
These worked perfectly to block hair from going down the drain and very easy to install
Super stylish look as well
Did not trap hair in the bathtub/shower
This product works super well
Love the colors and how cute they look as well
No complaints from me
"We just moved into a new house, and 2 weeks later were already putting Draino down the shower"
"this is exactly what I've been looking for, and super easy to use"
It's cute color and it work
"Although the silicon doesn't suck well into the tub and move easily but once there's water running, it does help hold it in place"
These silicon drain covers fit over the drain
They are flat on one side & have multiple half inch fingers that are at right angle to the bottom of the drain cover
"When placed over a drain while running water, there is nothing that holds the drain cover to the area, so it moves around & off the drain"
It does work if you wait to place it over the drain before draining the water
The pastel colors are pretty
I was disappointed with the performance
This product is great and caught all the hair
My drain won't have any problems being clogged in the future
Would recommend
Basically just floats on top of the water
"The only time it will stay over the drain is when it is held down by the weight of hair on it, but by that time it needs to be cleaned"
Now I have a whole box of these that I don't know what to do with
Product works great
It doesn't suction but I knew that when I ordered the Gotega Hair Catcher
Very good product
Gets the job done
No hair goes down the train and it sticks without moving
"With curly hair, washing my hair has caused the shower drain to get clogged up easily"
With these I am able to wash my hair and not worry about my hair going down the drain
"I love these, the colors are very pretty, the only thing is that I wished that I would have found these sooner"
Bought for our shower
I have long hair
It does the job and keeps the hair from going down the drain
Perfect for my daughters longer hair in the shower
"Bought these to keep hair from clogging my shower drain, they do the job well and they are the most affordable option I found on amazon"
Would highly recommend
Usefull product
I really enjoyed these for my shower
"I have long hair, and it consistently falls into the drain when I wash my hair"
This keeps me from having to buy Drain-O all the time
They don't stick and the water won't drain
"It catches the hair, but it slides all over"
Really irritated we wasted our money
We ended up tossing them
"Doesn't work, at all"
It slowed the drainage of water and caused the tub to fill a little with water which made the silicone hair catcher float and not stay connected to the drain for it to catch the hair
These are aesthetically pleasing which is kind of random for a hair catcher for your drain but again I take joy in my coasters from Anthropologie
Why not take advantage of what looks good and is useful as well
"I was surprised at the size of these, almost covers my whole hand so it will definitely fit any drain you've got"
This was a pretty good hair catcher
"It didn't float away when I took a shower, and kept all my hair from going down the drain"
The hair did get tangled up a bit in the holes though
Overall good product nonetheless
In general the product does it's job but it did not work for my bathroom sink because of the sink already having a stopper attached
I had to purchase another brand from OXO that fit over the tub sink
I ended up using one of these items in my kitchen sink and so far it has stayed in place and stopped larger items from going down the drain
Exactly what I was looking for to keep dog hair out of the drains
Product colors were cute
Design is simple and easy to use
Does not exactly suction to the bottle of my bathtub but it will get the job done
Works great
Immediate results if you have long or thick hair
Alot easier than cleaning it out of the drain
Haven't tried it yet but look sturdy
"The hair catcher actually works and fits over my shower drain, seems durable enough for everyday use"
This product does not really suction to anything it just sits on top of the drain
"When I turn the water on and it comes out the spout for the tub, the hair catcher does move"
So it is not good for baths
It would float
"Otherwise, it works fine for the shower"
I just push it over top of the drain once I turn the shower water on and it's good to go
Not a terrible product
Works great
Perfect size and stays in place
Easy to clean
Good
Hate to say it
These suck
Don't waste your money
Don't catch any hair & don't even stay in place if you have a shower with any water pressure
awesome
"We used this hair catcher in our bathtub, but it has had its problems"
It moves around easily and has too big holes to catch all the hair
Not recommended
"Used in kitchen, bathroom sink, and bathtub"
Loved the no installation process and easy to clean
Very sturdy product
I am loving it so far
It's a good product but it depends on how your bath tub drain is placed or shapes
It did not fit in one of my bathroom so I had to cut the middle part to fit
In the other bathroom it fit perfectly and works great
The product is good quality and easy to use
Great price
Works perfectly in my shower
"I have long, thick, curly hair and this hair catcher keeps it from clogging my drain"
Works great
We put one in our shower and our washer sink to keep out the lint
Does the trick
It didn't stay in place at all
My hair is absolutely a nightmare to get out of the shower and this has made it 100% easier
Just slap it on the drain and clean it after your shower
Catches curly hair really well
Very easy and convenient
Works as described
These hair catchers are very pretty and work well enough
They are a little light weight so they move around a bit but still get the job done
I do like how they will be easy to clean
Worked well
Suction could be better
But other than that 5 stars
Nice size
Great that they come with 5 in the pack
Does an excellent job of catching my hair
These hair catchers are so simple and effective
Catches hair
"I have three girls, all of whom have long hair"
And so you can imagine how often i had to clean their clogged drain full of hair
Just a day of use and you can see all the hair trapped on it after they shower
Now leaves as to who will clean it out
"They do what they are supposed to do, but they do move around quite easily in the shower"
It did not work as expected
It does not catch much hair
This is overall a great product for the price
It's cost effective and has been doing the job since we've put it on capturing the hair
I like that there isn't a suction cup and the colors are nice to interchange if you are a bit indecisive with the color scheme for current/future projects
I don't stand on it but it's nice to know it isn't metal or will hurt/break if I accidentally do
I like it because it has given me a solution for my three bath tubs
"With kids, hairs and other stuff can get stuffed easily but this product easily catch those"
Thanks
I bought the these too help prevent anymore of my long hair from tangling up in the shower drain and causing water backups
As soon as I received them I put one in the shower and after a week I can seriously say that they work beautifully
I was able to just lift it off the shower drain opening and the hair was no longer plugging the drain
Price and quality make these a very good investment
Colorful options to match various bathroom decors
Covers drain and collects so drain stays clean
"How is this supposed to catch any hair, when it floats around the shower"
Preformed as stated
Catch hair but hard to get hair off it
Does the job
Our drain is 4
"75"" and is recessed, so most of the other covers don't work very well"
These covers work great and look nice
It's also nice that they come in a pack so can be readily replaced if they get gross
Cute and functional
Seems to be nice
Just unboxed and haven't tried it yet
"Good color options, catches the hair"
But the suction isn't so great
I have to keep placing it back over the drain because it moves with the water pressure
This product has been very helpful in catching all hairs so that they do not go down the drain
They are easy to install and very pretty
These suck
They don't stick to anything
Didnt catch anything
Great product
We love it
Tried other hair traps and this is by far the best
Throw in the garbage
We love the color options and it's so easy to clean
We use one in the tub and one in the kitchen sink
Works perfectly
Didn't work
"Great product, does an overall good job and looks cute"
"Comes in a packet of 5, all different colors as seen on the picture"
Note that you will need to clean it every time you wash your hair so that it doesn't look bad in your bathtub
I love
the ease of use and a sorted variety of colors
The price also is ridiculously soft in my opinion
Work great to cover all size drains
I ordered these obviously to prevent drain issues
As you can see in the pic they are bigger than I expected
About 5 inches in diameter
Love the colors also
Very easy to clean
Installation is a no brainer
"It doesn't stay on my shower drain, and my hair collects around it(Not on the top of it)"
Also water doesn't drain properly
Honestly love the colors
Bigger than expected but it's no problem
Just took a shower and it stayed on well
Plus caught hairs
Does the job and looks nice
Doesn't look tacky like others I've seen
Love the different colors
I recommend this product to keep hair out of your drain
Great price too
Arrived promptly and as described
Product as described
Works great and beautifully made
The multicolors it comes in are beautiful
There ok i guess
The hair Catcher comes with 5 different colors and work out well to me
It is easy to use and clean it up
"With this help, I don't need to worry about the drain got stocked"
The deal works out as well
"Just got the covers, and they are easy to install and remove"
Hopefully they function as good as they look
"Works great, catches all the hair, colors are pretty cool"
"We ordered these thinking they would fit our shower drain, but are a little too big"
They do a good job of stopping the hair and allow the water and shampoo to drain
"However, we will be buying one in a smaller size to fit our needs"
I use this in the shower and it has helped immensely from keeping hair from going down the drain
Easy to use and clean -love the colors too
"It works, period"
Catches all the hair
Product itself seems alright
"It could definitely have better design, I thought bottom would have stick out so it will hold the place in drain"
It tends to move around
Overall built quality and material is good
"No complaints, works like a charm"
It doesn't fit the drains but just sits on it and still does very good job of catching hair
Works great
Works awesome
Gets the job done
Stops the hair from going down the drain
"It works well for both the sink and the bath tub, and very helpful in stopping the hair and easy to clean"
Excellent for showers or sinks
My hair falls out so bad and this catches it great
Perfect for our sink to keep things from falling down my drain since I lost the little thing
This product is super easy to use and very big in size so it will fit all drains
Much bigger than I expected
Suction well - use in the sink but wish they were just a little smaller
I lose a lot of hair when taking a shower
I noticed this would let a lot of hair slip through
If your like me I'd purchase another option as this could cause drainage issues in the future
Covers the shower drain perfectly
Didnt fit I returned
works fine but moves around
Works well for shower drains
this hair catcher works well and does catch hair but it can be a little work to clean because it gets stuck in all the little areas and underneath
It catches hair in my shower and that was the purpose for this
Easy to remove and clean
They did not catch hair as I expected
"They caught some hair, but very little"
They do not adhere to the floor of the shower
"The hair slides under the apparatus, which is why there is little hair in the 'trap"
'  I ordered another hair catcher that works much better
"Great company, great traction for the hair to get caught on and cute colors"
"easy to use, just place it down to filter out unwanted hair or waste"
Need more suction- slips off the drain if bumped
perfect for cleanliness
I have long hair and I am always trying to stop as much hair as possible from going down the drain
I have had my shares of clogged drains
I have to say I wasn't sure if this would work the way I wanted it to but it sure did
It worked like a charm
I liked the fact that you had colors to choose from
It's easy to pick up and clean and remove the hair
I would highly recommend this product
I also didn't encounter any issues with it not suctioning either
It stayed in it's place both in the shower and the sink
"Cheap, effective, works as advertised"
Great at stopping hair
Easy to clean and catches a ton of hair
No more clogged drains for me
Works well for catching hair
Not as secure as I would have liked
Easy to clean and use
Good price for 5 pieces
Good for shower/tub drains
I just received this
"Installing/using is super easy, just put on drain"
I still have to test it so will update after I use it for a week
The box came with 5 ( I have 3 shower tubs ) which one is for 4 girls ( lots of showers with significant hair collecting on drain on a daily bases ) so seeing how it will holds with different usages will be interesting
Works great
Works excellent
Would recommend
"Liked the look of it, but don't think it is doing much to keep hair from going down the drain"
Too flat for some sink stoppers and no suction to keep it in place
This hair catcher does work for trapping hair but the only problem is too thick
"It blocks the water flow, causing longer water drain"
I guess I didn't read the ad closely so I was so pleasantly surprised when there were 5 of these in the package
The colors are really beautiful and I have them in every sink in my house now
They work great at keeping hair or shampoo caps or really anything from going down the drain
Very effective and well made
Would not stay in place
Works great but it doesn't stick to the floor at all and slides all over the place
If you don't put it the perfect spot it doesn't work
I liked that I received so much for so little
collects hair
seems to stay put under both running & draining water
I just received my shower drain covers
"They are attractive and easy to place in your tub, or sink"
I will check back in a month to report how well it catches long hair
So far so good
"These are larger than I expected, but I am happy with that"
"My hair is extra fine, and this still catches it just fine"
"The colors are not vibrant, but I am content with them"
The colors work well with my bathroom/
Works so great
I shed A LOT and it catches every piece
And I love that it comes in a pack of 5
Easy to use
Good product but moves a lot
These are the best things your could buy for your plumbing
I shed like a dog and these little disks help catch it all
"Insanely fast shipping, I got mine next day and I'm in the boondocks lol"
And awesome price for all 5
Extremely happy costumer
The best thing I liked about this was that it could fit over my shower drain (I am unable to use the ones that stick in the hole so this was perfect because it sits on top of the drain)
Does not catch all hairs but it does a standard job of keeping the drain clog-free for the most part
these came in a pack so will be easy to rotate them out when I clean them
Good product
Some hair slips under the product but good at catching most of the hair
Great for a household of three girls with long hair
These were super easy to install
My shower and all our upstairs sinks
I can't wait to see how they work
I dont see any suction power but does the job
They do exactly what they are supposed to
They don't stop up the water too much and they are very easy to clean
Nice product
"These stoppers are actually bigger than I envisioned, which is great since the drain in the master shower is big"
It covers perfectly
Works great
Would definitely order again
"The product does what it's says it will do, catch hair"
They were larger than I expected so I was happy
They suction well to the sink when the drain plug is fully seated
I unfortunately have a drain plug that sticks up further than the the catcher
But my hair is so long that it gets caught on the catcher regardless
I would recommend this product
I orginally bought it for our kitchen sink but it doesn't fit properly so we've been using them for our showers and it works perfectly
I think it works but I didn't use it for long
It kept on moving when I shower and it floats when I take a bath
I replaced it with ones that have suction cups instead
Never going back
I love that these catch the hair from such a wide space and I love how good the suction is
Also super happy they come in a pack of 5 so I don't have to worry about needing a new one for quite a while
had a little trouble keeping it stay but in the end got it to work
it catches everything
This product works well at trapping hair in my shower
The package is a great value for the price
Just got it and it seems to be doing the job
Great Price
This pulls right off tub and hair is easily wiped off to clean the stopper
No clogs in a hole that drops into tub drain to worry with
Works over my tub drains with no stops and shower drain
Excellent product
Works perfectly
"It catches the hair fine, but they don't stay in place especially with an abundance of water"
Could do better with better suction
"Works well, get a 5 pack, cute colors, very worth the price"
work great and are inexpensive
you get five in a pack which is helpful
very easy to use and clean off
Perfect size for shower and bath drains
They were an excellent choice for us
It really works
I wish it was an easier way to clean it
The price and quality are outstanding
Highly recommend
"Easy to install, use and most importantly, clean"
Great value
"easy to install, catches all my hairs and it looks great"
Works better than I imagined it would
Stops a good amount of hair from getting into the drain
Like it alot
Lots of options for a good price
Fits over a variety of drain sizes and the grooves do a good job of catching hairs of various lengths
V satisfied and cute colors too
These are definitely worth the price
Functions as it should
They feel soft and not too hard of a silicone to stand on in the shower
A good size
"Bigger than I had expected, which is good because it covers the whole drain"
Nice product
Hoping to built more bathrooms in the house so I can use these to cover the drains
"You get a lot in a package, wish you could order all in the same color"
Work great
Very convenient
reasonable prices
I love amazon
"I always get my orders whether first, second, or third party vendors fast"
will recommend to others
"We like it a lot, doesn't hurt if you step on it"
Catches hair
"Moves around a little, but it's not a problem"
Works well
Does exactly as it should
Nice pop of color
I love these
These are easy to install and their is a color to match that rooms decor
Would definitely recommend and order again
I wish I could give 3
5 stars because I would
So this thing is a silicone circle with a flat/smooth side and a side with little teeth
There are holes in the center that drain the water
"There's no installation, you simply lay the circle on top of the drain"
I have hip length hair that's pretty fine
"By the time I'm done in the shower there's hair on the walls, in the drain, on the curtain, and basically everywhere else"
"CONS: The catcher doesn't sit well on surfaces that aren't flat, so if you are using it for a bathroom sink or an uneven tub/shower, it won't work"
"The holes in the top of it are huge, so if you have fine slippery hair, it's very likely it won't catch all of it"
It also prevents the water from draining quickly to the point that it looks at my feet
"This isn't a huge problem for me, it's just kind of annoying"
PROS: The price was great and it comes in 5 different colors and you get 5 catchers
It's a good deal
You can wash one while using another or if you have multiple drains you can use a few
It did catch SOME of my hair but not all
"Once I applied conditioner and my hair was super slippery, some got past the teeth on the top"
"Finally, it's super easy to use"
You literally just set it on top of whatever drain you are using
"Overall, I'm not mad at it but I'm not jumping with joy"
I will continue to use them since it did catch some hair
"However, I wouldn't recommend them to a friend or repurchase unless I was superrrr desperate"
It was easy to place and fit over my large drain
Would recommend
I purchased for a shower tub
There is no suction so the drain catcher does not remain in place but can float if water accumulates
I also placed a fine mesh drain catcher underneath to process the power of this product to do its job
There was more hair in the mesh drainer than in this
Perfect for catching my long hair
love this product
has a beautiful assortment of colors and is extremely effective in catching the hair
I have a bathroom with a shower that has no drain
"I plan to remodel it soon, but until then I've been looking for an inexpensive solution to keep hair and anything else from going down the drain"
I love these silicone hair stoppers
Great colors and so far has been staying in place and doing what it's supposed to do
"The suction doesn't work super great but that's not due to the product, but instead due to the small square tiles on the floor of shower"
My drain cover broke so I needed something that would cover the drain and keep hair from going down the drain
These were the right size and did the job well
The price is very good for these too
Great product
"These hair catchers are plenty large to cover any size drain, stay put and catch hair effectively"
"And for as many as you get for the price, these are simply an excellent value"
I like that this product comes in an assortment of color
"Although it doesn't have a suction to it, it does stay in place your whole shower time"
It's east to install and to clean out
So far so good
"High quality and really pretty product, I don't ha e to worry about my hair clogging the drain anymore"
Very nice colors and super easy to use
"The suction on the hair catcher allows it to stay in place on both glass, metal, and poly surfaces"
Catches long pieces of hair and paper labels that my kids leave floating in the tub constantly
Easy to clean
"For the jacuzzi, I cut a hole so that it could fit securely on the drain"
"It works ok, could be better"
Doesn't catch everything from going down the drain
I love these stoppers
The colors are great and in line with the walls/rooms in my house
They are easy to use and work great
No more clogged drains
This is an excellent replacement to the shower drain chain we had
This captures all the hair before it even enters the drain
Easy to clean
"Have not used yet but easy to install, little bit for my sink but seems like it will work"
I love this product great and easy to use
mainly use it for a hair catcher
"Works as expected, nice colors"
"All the stoppers in our sinks broke and these stoppers are a perfect, easy solution"
They look great and work well
"I like the colors - subtle, muted colors go with any decor"
Covers the drain completely and easy to clean
Product works as it should
Easiest thing I ever installed
When I got these I wasn't sure
I love the colors but it didn't seem like it would work
It does pretty well
"Even in the bath tub with the water right on it, it stays pretty much in the same spot (some movement)"
The picture is from my pug's bath and as you can see it caught a lot of the hair (which is great)
Nice Product
This product is so useful since my long hair somehow always end up clogging the drain every few months
Whenever that happened I would always have to take it out manually
Now with this I won't have to worrying about clogging up the drain
I do not recommend purchasing this
The holes are way too large to catch any hair
I have long black hair and I definitely sense a Draino experience coming on
I clean about zero hair from this
I'm so disappointed
"I would return, but my toddler son threw one away already"
I will have to take the $10 loss
This is a lifesaver with a house full of girls
No more clogged drains in the shower
"Holds great, catches the hair, and is easy to clean"
They are bigger than I expected which is a good thing
It fits perfectly in the tub
And catches hair easy
I like that I can easily remove it
This was a great buy for the price
Works well to catch hair
Item is large enough to cover shower drain without requiring suction
Easy to clean and plenty of replacements in pack if necessary
Looked like a great deal- but- they do not stay in place
I am still snaking the drain  routinely
Can't beat this for the price
I used one of these in my shower to catch my long hair and they work nicely
I gave one to my daughter to
"You can use them too, to keep small items from escaping down your sink drain"
They install easily at the bottom of the sink bowl
Seems to be a good job retaining hair
I was looking for an affordable hair catcher for my drain and this one works perfectly
I love the color selection and the fact that there are multiple in the package
"This product is very useful on catching hair on shower and the look is good since it have different color choices, I like it because you can easily remove the hairs that are caught by it and the colors are very cure"
Works as advertised
These do not work
I put them in my kitchen sink and food goes underneath and still into the drain
"The same thing with catching hair in the shower, it goes right underneath and down the drain"
Do not recommend buying this product
I like the way the piece fits over the drain
I am using it in my sink
Good product
I like the pastel colors
"Water drains fast while collecting hairs, which I like especially because A LOT of long thick hairs fall off during my showers"
"Good suction, good assortment of color, traps a lot of hair"
I really wanted this to work
They are attractive and stay in place
I put one on my shower drain and left it through several showers
Not one hair on it when I picked it up
I read previous reviews that said it was great so I have no idea why it didn't work for me
Product is great
5 drain covers for $10
Deal city
I have really long hair that clogs up our shower so bad that we've had to snake the drain so I needed something to cover it
These have a lot of texture so they grip all the hair before t can get down the drain
I also put one in my kitchen sink to catch any food and that's worked great as well
I hate reaching my fingers into the mushy drain and the drain catcher for the kitchen sink doesn't let any water down
These are perfect
Highly recommend
Easy to install
I need something simple that doesn't get in the way when showering
It worked just as expected
"The hair slides under it, it does not stop it"
This is awesome
Very easy to use and effectively stopping all solid stuffs from going into the drainage

"png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;I've gone through a couple different types of hair catchers over the last few years, most recently trying one of the newer mushroom-style plugs, but have tended to be disappointed with their functionality"
"Decided to try these, figuring that it was a good deal to get a packet of four so I could have a few replacements ready as they wear out"
You can check out my video for a quick look at the construction of the parts and my thoughts on the quality
I've been using the catchers for about a week now and they seem to do a good job of catching hair
One thing you need to be aware of is that they are designed to work with drains that do not have a tall stopper in the middle
"Also, if you have a tub/shower setup where you start the water from the main faucet and then switch to the shower, you'll want to make sure the catcher stays in place for the first few seconds while the strong flow of water hits the tub"
Good value for the money
I've paid this much for just one hair catcher
"I didn't read the details before I got them, so they came in larger than expected, but it works really well"
nice colors and seems to do the trick with catching hair
easy install and cleaning
Three would have been OK but I'll take the 5
Very useful
These are awful
Don't purchase these
It does not catch hair
"Easy to use, easy to replace"
Catches the hair and does clog with suds
These work well
It was great for my apartments
It provides an easy way to prevent clogging drains
I would recommend this to others
Waste of money used one and threw them all away
Tbh these SUCK
They're such an eye sore & alot of hair still falls thru it
I wish it has some sort of suction on the bottom so it wouldn't move so much either
This is totally simple and easy
It catches the hair along the edges and makes it simple to pull off and clean
The colors are pretty and camouflage any discoloration from hair dye/soap scum
There were 2 different size slots to catch hair or anything else that finds its way to the drain
Love this product
This works really well and it gets so many hairs
My hair falls out a lot so this really does save me time on getting all the hairs out
I am happy that I got to try this out because its making my life a lot easier
Its easy to apply and remove
This "hair catcher" does exactly what it's supposed to
Super easy to clean too
i am very glad that I got this wonderful product
Does what it's supposed to do very well
"Working good so far, they don't stick much to your sink or tub but does the job and they are very cute"
Easy to use
Ordered it to save our drains from dog hair
I like it
Perfect size and i love the colors
I was expecting smaller size; my fault; I did not do due diligence
Will use in shower and bathtub
These don't seem to catch anything
My drain still keeps getting reclogged with long hair even with using these religiously
I would pass on purchasing them and find something that has smaller holes or a different design
"Clogs water too, so you have to move it which then how is it catching the hair"
Worked just as advertised
This item does not catch hair in the shower and in the bathtub it floats
The colors are great and it catches hair well
It tends to move off it's mark when you first turn the water on
These hair catchers seem like they will be perfect
I am sick of having to unclog the drain and these silicone pads will definitely catch most of not all my hair before it hits the drain
Haven't had any issues
Also love all the colors
You can only use this product if the shower the drain is flat and there is no suction
It does the job and catches hair and easy installation (all you have to do is place on the drain)
Colors are nice and works well
Great price
Happy to receive this item so quickly
Made very well with durable soft rubber/silicon and 5 of them in different colors is a great deal
We have one in our shower and kids shower
"Does lift up a bit with bath/shower tubs with pop-up push drain plugs , but still catches hair"
"They worked well in the shower/tub but tried to use in my sink and when the drain was open, it wouldn't sit flat in the sink"
"It works great, the drainage slows a little but that could just be our shower as we have a hard time with that anyway"
"But it definitely catches all the hair, easy to use and easy to clean"
"This hair catcher is big, so it is ment to be used in a shower or bathtub, not a regular sink"
"It works ok, not great"
I tried putting in both sides and finally opted for having the smooth side down
"It seems that is the best way, but it slides off sometimes"
"Works as intended, don't really have anything negative to talk about with the product"
"Overall, I'm pretty happy~"
"Very good, does job well"
Catches hair and easy to clean
I use this in my bath tub and kitchen sick
It's perfect and I would recommend
Odd size
No suction what so ever
They float
returned them for refund
Great product
"Catches most hair, but it doesn't stick as tight as I'd expect"
Fair value for the price
Easy to clean
Love it
Placed in tubes and sinks
Too light and not sucked to the floor very well
Hairs flow under it to the drain
Not recommended
Great product for flat surfaces- best for showers or kitchen sinks
"Doesn't stay in place, and did not catch a single hair"
I guess that made it easy to clean
These hair catchers are made out of quality silicone and come in five nice colors
I was actually surprised that the colors were much more sophisticated than the pictures showed
"The pictures made them look brighter as if more suited for a kid's bathroom; however, in-person they were actually warm, muted tones"
"I haven't tried the product out yet, but I placed them on our drain and it fits well"
"Overall, the product looks promising"
The stopper to my bathroom sink hasn't worked properly in years so I took it out
"During this time, and despite futile attempts to be careful, I've dropped everything from earrings, toothpaste caps, q-tips, tweezers, and various other items down the sink"
"These fun, colorful drain covers fit perfectly and protect items from my inherit clumsiness"
Very decorative too
Wish I had purchased them earlier
Highly recommend
It won't stay in place
It didn't catch a lot of hair either when it was in place
Great product
My hair falls out like crazy and clogs the bathtub at least once a week
"I've tried everything, but this has worked the best"
"I don't have a strong stomach when it comes to hair, so this easy to clean catcher is so helpful"
Every shower and bathtub should have these hair catcher to keep hair from clogging drain pipe
"These made out of soft silicone when i step on it, my food doesn't hurt so bad"
I love the vintage pastel it goes well my white shower
"Most importantly, the hair catcher catches hair in my shower"
Great product and a good variety of colors
Works perfectly for my shower
Very useful and come with 5 different color
Love it
They were good
Fits all drain sizes
Very well designed and constructed
Catches most of the hair in the shower
No suction so it doesn't stay in place
"These are nice and large to cover my entire drain, they stay in place for the most part, and they do catch a lot of my long hair"
The color options are nice and I like that it's silicone in case you step on it
Super easy to pick up and clean out
I had an issue with the product and customer service responded right away
Product as described
Great Quality
Like this product
Great for catching hair
Good product
Hard to cleanstain easyslide off drains easy
catches the hair well and is pretty
"These slide around a lot, but if you dont mind having to constantly put it back in place they do the job"
Love
These were actually bigger than I thought which is perfect
They catch all the hair and drains as if it wasn't even there
A few other ones I've tried slowed the drain down but not these
I definitely recommend
This was exactly what I needed to collect the hair before it goes down the drain
So happy with this purchase
Thank you Amazon
We bought this product because our new RV has metal grates instead of one you can insert a stopper in
The product works well and catches hair as advertised
Like that there's more than one in the pack
We have 2 bathrooms
Silicone is the best material for these things
I love this product
It's super easy to use
I able to use it on my vanity sink and bath tub
Highly recommended
Doesnt stick to surface
These work well on a flat drain
I had to cut a small hole in the center of one to fit on a tub drain with a knob
It took less than two minutes and works great
These are great
"These worked great, and the variety of colors was a bonus"
This sits well in the shower drain
It catches hair but still some goes through
Very easy setup and definitely stops hair from clogging the drain
Would recommend if you don't want your drains clogged
"This hair catcher package is very good, its silicone material looks very resistant, the best is very easy to use, the package contains 4 and they are different colors, I liked them a lot"
did not stop any hair
did not stay in the drain
If stepped on they slopped
very sad they didn't work
Cool
work great for my shower
stops all my wife's hair
These things suck and will not stay in place I definitely would not recommend purchasing them they do not do what they're supposed to do
I got this to replace a metal mesh drain cover
"It's a bit bigger than I expected, but it works well"
"My kids have long, curly hair that regularly clogs our drain and overpowered the metal cover"
This cover eliminates that issue
Product catches hair
Good for the value
This was exactly what I needed so my hair doesn't get stuck in my drain
It's a large size that covers the whole drain
Happy with this purchase
Works as described
Thank you
"i was worried this wouldn't work since there are no suction cups or fancy installation, but this works perfectly"
i have a lot of hair and have clogged my shower drain many times
this seemed like it wouldnt work since it just sits on top of the drain (no suction cups) but it didnt move at all and caught a ton of hair
highly recommend
There is basically no installation and it seems to be catching all of my long hair
"It is nice there are back-ups so if it gets dirty or breaks, I am already prepared"
Works great for my shower
There is no suction on my sink
Only suitable for bigger wider sinks
"Really good deal for the price, nice colors, only design flaw in my opinion is that it doesn't stick to the shower floor as well as I'd hoped, it moves around a tiny bit but overall very effective"
Would definitely recommend this product to a friend
Good product
Doesn't stay in place
If you put it over the drain several times throughout the shower it will collect hair
Wonderful
This thing was easy to place over the drain
We have a scorpion problem so it helps keep them from crawling up as well
"I've kept it in Kitchen, bath tub and bathroom sink"
it works great for all and perfect fit for the purpose
I lose a lot of hair when in the shower and it always clogs the drains and these work great in preventing that from happening
"They're easy to use, stays in place and easily cleaned off after"
Love the colors and the amount I get per pack
I placed one in each of our bathrooms and one in the kitchen sink
I offered my last one to a friend who experiences similar problems and she said it works well and will be purchasing some for her household too
I wanted to like it
I need it
But it doesn't work as advertised
It doesn't catch anything
It just floats away in the water
"The moment you turn on the water in the tub, it begins to float away and will not stay seated in place by the drain"
"It is useless as it doesn't catch my hair, or any other debris"
I messaged the seller but the email bounced back as "undeliverable" because the seller doesn't have an up to date email address
So there seems to be no way to contact the seller about this problem
Looks like I'll have to go through Amazon for a refund
"I CANNOT recommend this, and would NOT buy it ever again"
I was buying this type of product at Walmart for 10
00 a piece
This one is great since I bathe my dog in the tub
Its also much easier to clean than my previous ones
Good purchase
Loved the quality and price point
They are perfect
I received this today and started using right away
"Though there are no suction cups, the whole drain cover grips the shower floor, preventing it from moving too much"
"The silicone traps are a plus too, since it keeps the hair from going down the drain"
The beautiful colors and the price
"another pluses, if you ask me"
So much easier to clean than some other options and I'm thrilled it came with five so when it does get nasty I can throw on a new one
"I thought it would look ugly, but it's actually really subtle"
Works great so far
"The water drains a lot slower now, but it does its job by catching the hairs"
"My worry was that it would float away, but it hasn't yet"
"Clean, pretty, practical"
nice to have the extra ones for future use
They don't work
The colors are pretty but that's about it
This is great
Absolutely love it :))
Love the colors and the easy installation
Great price with high quality
One pack has 6 with different color
Really worth to buy
"It catches hairs very well , so I am not worry my hairs block the sink anymore"
I was looking for a product to catch hair that would go down the drain in the shower
These are a great size for the showers and easy to install and clean
Did not expect them to be so big
Originally was buying for the bathroom sink but were too big
They have worked well in my kitchen sink but they don't drain the water in the shower efficiently
Shower water doesn't drain quickly and water starts filling up
These are so durable and don't look dirty like my old white one I used previously
They catch hair well and keep our drains safe from clogging
These dont stick to the drain
So when water runs they just move around
Waste of money
"I bought it to catch hair in my shower drain, but it doesn't really work the holes are to big"
"Great deal, it slides right over any type of drain and stays in place really well unless intentionally removed"
Does its job and collects my insane hair fall
These were processed and delivered quickly and are high quality material
There are alot of them so it is a good deal and they appear very easy to clean
They came in nice colors as well
Great product
"I love them , and they are really big"
"It's hard to suction at first but after you clean it and run water on it the first time, it starts working it magic"
It works on flat surfaces best
My drains will never be clogged again
Works well enough but we have multiple long haired people showering so it gets clogged quickly
This product would be better if they had suction cups on them
"When the water runs, it moves all over the place not catching any hairs"
It's not a good product at all
It only catches few of the hairs
This hair catcher fits over my tub and my shower drains
"The suction power is ok BUT for the price, this is definitely a great buy"
Gets the job done
Would purchase again
It collects hairs very well
"I have long hair, and have tried several products including the tub shroom but this by far the best, easy to install and gets the job done"
Great quality at a great price
I have long thick hair and keeping my hair out of the shower drain is a task
I bought these in hopes of being able to save my drain a little longer from getting clogged
I have one in my shower and one in the kitchen sink (keep random things from going down the drain)
I will say the water still drains well from both places
The shower one does do a good job of catching most of my hair prior to going down the drain
"The one bad thing is that if you step on the middle of the rubber stopper, the sides will lift up and water and hair will run under the stopper"
The drain in my shower is just a tiny bit lower than the shower floor (such a small amount you don't notice unless you are specifically looking for that fact)
There is no suction that I've noticed with these stoppers
"There is a small rubber piece in the middle of the bottom side that sticks out and I'm assuming is supposed to go into one of the drain holes to help hold it in place, however, it needs to be longer to really be effective"
"Despite all of this, I do still like the product and it does a good job of catching my hair"
Just try not to step on it too much and it's fine
I tired these for my kitchen sink and they just don't do a very good job
They catch food pretty well but strong water will push the food into the holes and probably the worst of it is that if a lot of water hits it at once it moves completely - no suction whatsoever
They're cute and might work in a shower but I have a hard time seeing how if there's a bunch of water coming at it
I'd try something else
Using one for each of the drains in the house
Easy to use and works well in shower stall and bathroom sink
Worked well and the fact that it comes with 5 for the price makes it absolutely worth it
Nice colors but did not suction to the tub
For a good price you get 5
And they work very well
No suction
"Sits on top of drain, and if you have a stopper it won't fit"
Does collect hair but gets in your way when showering
These were much higher quality than I expected
I got them because small things kept falling into the garbage disposal
It works perfectly for the sink
"I did put one in the bath tub and it kept moving, not sure if it was because of the way I position it or not"
Best shower hair catcher I've been able to find
Doesn't slide around and Catches everything without water filling up the tub
After two weeks the product seems to do its job
It seems to be catching hair in the bath drain
It is easy to pick out to clean off hairs
I am hoping that it does not get grimy and that my drain will not clog up
Works great
Cute and easy to use
Does what it's advertised to do
Colors are cute and make the white sink pop
Really good got those who shed a lot of hair
Great does it job
They work very well to catch hair in the shower I have 5 daughters so this is amazing
I cant seem to get it to suction yet
Works really well
"I was so tired of replacing the metal hair catcher/drain cover that I had in my shower because I'd forget it was there, step on it and leave a dent, then have to go out and buy another one"
"When I found these silicone multi-packs on amazon for less than the price of a metal one, I decided to try them and I'm so happy I did"
Now I can step on the drain all I want and still catch the hair before it disappears and make a clog
These wash off easily and it's super-simple to remove my long hair from the bottom of the shower
Great product and highly recommended
Easy to install and looks good
Awaiting how this product filters
I love how it works
Saves my drain
The hair catchers fit perfectly
"They are soft for one's feet in case you step on them, yet they stay in place"
We are looking forward to using them to prevent hair clogs in the shower drains for a long time
These work great and the color variations are fun
These are so cute and they work great
Easy to install
Beautiful colors
Bought these as an alternative to the more expensive hair catchers on the market hoping they would suffice for what I needed them for (collecting dog hair)
"Pros: Come in a pack of five, colors are as shown, flat surface, flexible, & easy to install/remove"
"Cons: NO SUCTION AT ALL (moves around easily), large openings allow hair to escape through to the drain, hair that is collected ends up on the opposite end of the catcher which is a pain to remove, doesn't allow water to escape tub resulting puddling while showering"
"Overall, I Would Not buy again, or recommend others to buy"
If you're looking for a great hair catcher that sits flat on the drain (assuming the original stopper has been removed) Target has one that works fantastic ($$)
Good quality silicone and larger than I thought it would be
Love that I got 5 different colors for such a low price
It is useless
just got the product and looks good so far
I can't wait to try it out
They did the job fine but were bigger than I expected so I returned them
Would buy again
"Does exactly what I needed, catching hair in the drain and preventing clogs"
"My old shower stopper drainer broke on me and got this one to replace it, I love it - so simple to set up and use, highly recommend"
Will be purchasing it again
Great product
Didn't fit on my bathtub drain but worked in my kitchen sinks and bathroom sink
Great little product
No hassle and easy application
Cute colors that look nice in the bathroom
Highly recommend
Nicely made
As other reviewers mentioned this type has no suction power
But it is easy to clean and does the work catching hairs
Color is dull
Works well for the price
Keeps hair from going down the drain without blocking the water flow
It does what its supposed to do
strainer
Good product
Works as advertised
Great pricing
Love the colors and that it's big enough to cover my drain
"Purchased this pack based on the positive reviews, but it's constantly moving around while I take a shower"
I would assume that most tubs dip down where the drain is which seems to cause this cover to "float" instead of staying in place to catch hair
"Basically, I think it's a terrible design and next I will purchase a drain protector that has a portion which actually sticks inside the drain to stay in place"
Definitely disappointed
Works well to prevent hair from going in my drain
Super easy to install in my bathroom
"Even if the design is simple, but it does work"
"Really love this product, price is also reasonable"
"It's easy to install and clean, and works very well"
"My mom came to my house and saw this, she bought some as well"
This is awesome for my shower
I have really long thick hair and alot falls out when washing it this hair catcher is great
"Nice quality, great price"
I don't have any complaints
Fit over the drain and catches the hair
Does its job
Works great
Fast delivery
So easy to use and keep our shower drain clean
honestly works so well
It actually catches the hair and is super easy to take off and clean
Would definitely recommend
I like that it catches hair and easy to use
It comes in a pack of 5
They are compact and easy to use
Get the job done for me
Love it
It works great
Works well
It does catches the hair
"Good quality, don't stay in place"
Ease of use
Seems like it will work
It does the job with catching hair for a shower drain even though it doesn't completely sit well on the drain
My shower isn't completely flat so that wasn't surprising
It's cute as well
This did not cover my drains the way that it said
The hair would go right underneath it
Very disappointed
I don't ever write these reviews but I was highly disappointed
Upon opening the product there was a long hair caught around the Hair Catcher
Obviously they sent me a returned product which in the case is disgusting
This catches my hair but I don't think it catches all of it because of how easily it moves around
"Overall, it does it's job but I think it would be 10x better with some kind of suction"
"Difficult to clean, hair gets stuck -great but then it takes you longer to clean it than to take a shower and competators have products that catch hair plus easy to clean"
I like these for catching hair when we are washing our hair (myself or my daughter)
We have had numerous issues with plumbing due to having hair caught in the pipes
This makes it easier
It works pretty well
I wis h there was better suction on the bottom for keeping it in place and the colors are slightly off from the picture
"But otherwise they work and cover more area to trap hair from the beginning, than I originally anticipated"
"Nice pastel colors, easy to install and remove, works effectively"
Got it for my dorm bathroom shower
"The colors are not as vibrant, but it works well for what it's for"
"Works great, love the different colors, love the price for the amount given"
"Simple to install, easy to clean"
We have been looking for an affordable hair catcher that does its' job
and finally found it
Simple design and works great
Recommend for all
Colors are a little ugly and it can shift around a little but overall it works fairly well
Great product totally recommend for people with lots of hair loss
Doesn't come with a suction cup bottom to grip on to the sink
"I didn't read the reviews that explain how it only works for flat drains before purchasing, BUT I came up with a solution and cut the very center out"
It works great with my pull up drain now
"This product is amazing especially the fact that you get five of these for the 10 dollars, so far it has been catching my of the hair in my shower and really easy to clean I def Recomend this product esp if you have family members with long hair"
I have natural afro-curly hair and these worked great for my shower
Daughter has long hair and I have three cats
We've only had these a few days but they work as intended
We are thankful to have the three spare ones too since the cats already believe the one in the shower is a chew toy ;)
Note five of these cost same as two individual ones we found elsewhere on Amazon
Catches hair from multiple directions with the placement of cutouts and with the textured bumps
Doesn't cause water to slow down (other brands created water build up and didn't drain fast enough) Easy to clean and will last us longer than other brands and materials we've tried
"The item looks cute in the shower, I like it much more than the metal hair catchers, however it doesn't seem to stick to the tub very well"
But still serves its purpose
Works as needed
The hair catcher is easy to place and remove and adds a pop of color
I would recommend
This product didn't work at all
"It's ""easy installation"" because you just plop it over the top of the drain, but it doesn't stick at all"
The whole time I showered it just kept slipping off the drain so it didn't catch any hair at all
Really bad product
It was great and easy to use
I have been so frustrated with the hair stoppers I have had in the past
This one is soooo easy to clean and I don't have to worry about my drain getting clogged either
Easily installed or removed
Hubby very happy he does not need to remove hair clogs any longer
Does not catch hair
Most of it slipped the put the catcher and down the drain
I bought one from Walmart before that I recently tore in accident and that one was great
This does nothing
Does not suction down as advertised
Pretty but doesn't stick
We just moved into new city and have lot of hair fall issues for me and my daughter
We didn't want to end up spending a lot on plumbing related works for the water blockage
These silicon hair catcher woks wonders
"I also put that on kitchen sink, and bathroom sinks"
It works perfectly fine
It is cost effective too
We didn't have a plug for the bathroom and this saved us from losing valuable items and clogging out drain with hair
Totally fast shipping and I'll always order for this reason
These do not auction AT ALL to the drain
"They slide all over, and are painful to step on, as you never know where it is once you get into the shower"
Would not buy again
Perfect size for a larger shower drain
Catches hair without inhibiting water drainage
"Package contains 5 covers, variety of colors"
These work very well
My daughters can remove and clean them
"With 3 long haired girls in our home, this definitely saves on having to call the plumber to clear our drain"
If you're a guy that's trying to block small hairs from getting in the sink when shaving his facial hair
this product is completely ineffective
They definitely catch a lot of hair
Just hard to clean off after (my hair seems to tangle around the product and I find it gross to have to aggressively rip it off)
"It does cause the water to drain a bit more slowly from my shower, but other than that, it's fine"
These are super amazing
"So my hair kept going down the drain and we had to declog it every week, it was bad"
I found these and they work
"Only thing is when you switch from shower to bath, the running bath water moves the hair catcher and you have to grab it before it moves and the hair comes off"
Although the hair twines in the nuns so it doesn't come off too easily
Other wise it works for what we need it to
Wish it actually had a suction cup bottom or on the sides or something
But we love it
Works great
These would float away and around the tub if water pool a bit over them
They barely prevented hair from going into thedrain as well
I used this product in my shower to cover the drain
It was great for catching hair to stop my drain from getting clogged
"I also used one in my kitchen sink, I don't have a garbage disposal so little pieces of food were always going down the drain and clogging my sink"
Now the food is getting caught on the covers and it is so easy to clean
This hair catcher mostly stays in place and always catches hair going down the drain
These hair catchers are great
I have a lot of hair and it sheds as I shower
I like that the hair catchers come in five different colors because I tend to change my bathroom decor and color scheme quite often
They are made of a rubbery material with spikes that stop the hair before it enters the drain
"The hair catchers are of good quality, easy to remove and clean"
Product fits well on drain
Had to remove the tub drain to fit
Works great fast and quixk
Does work really well for it to catch as much hair it can
but it doesnt really have any suction ability
Quick and easy on & off
Awesome product and easy install
Working on keeping it in place for the shower but very effective to catch items
This product works really great for showers or for places where you have flatter drains
However if u have a drain that sticks out this may not be the best option for you
Love the hair catcher
Works in multiple settings and I love the colors
Easy to clean as well
Bought this to catch my wife's long hair before it goes down the drain
"Unfortunately after weeks of use, no hair has been stopped by it"
It barely caught any hair
My hair is long and fine and it slipped right through
These work REALLY well
I have very fine hair that always clogs the shower drain
This really catches it well and is easy to clean
Great buy and very affordable
These are SO cute; I love the colors and it is a great value for 5 covers
What I like most about them is that they are flat and easy to clean sometimes ones that have a "dip" to them get caked on grime over time
These are easy to clean and very cute I love the dusty neutral colors
Product works great as far as I could tell
Really appreciate the speedy delivery
The product is overall good and durable
Will have to see how it works time wise for my long hair
I haven't seen hair caught on the hair trap yet
I will wait for another week or so
I love these drain catchers
I use them in all of my bathrooms and they are a game changer
They are cute and do a great job at stopping the hair but allowing water to still flow with no interruption
I've always been plagued by clogged drains due to the buildup of hair
"Now that I have these hair catchers, my drain should never be clogged again"
Gets the job done very well and easy to use
These hair catchers are easy to use and catch all our hair in the shower
They are easy to clean and I love the fun colors
Never stayed down on my tub
Wound up getting another product
"Amazing product , no more unclogging the drain"
Great colors and nice to have enough for all drains
La calidad definitivamente es muy buena y justo lo que esperaba
I've been having shortcomings when it comes to finding a hair catcher that works for my tub
This is the only one that worked on top of it being a 5 pack for the price
"I will say this based on my experience all hair catchers aren't created equal, this one so happened to be the one that worked out for me"
Product is great for catching hair in shower drain
Catches hair fairly well
"I have a standing shower, so the water doesn't drain as well, and I have to move it on occasion"
I don't think it catches as much hair as I would like
I think it would do better in a bathtub with an indented drain
This is probably the only product I've bought that actually catches hair
I want to like these - I really do but the suction power is non existent and they will move around or even float away if too much water hits it
The colors and design are nice though
Did not fit my drains
Beautiful colors and they do the job
These seem durable
The colors are nice to hide any grime that may build up
Nice product
It doesn't have suction though so when I step on it in the shower it moves a bit
Maybe should have shopped a bit more for similar product but with suction cups
"That said, I appreciate the colors and design"
It is attractive and function
Although the suction power isn't as strong as I'd hoped - it gets the job done
"As long as the shower faucet isn't on, it stays put"
I like how easy it is to remove/install - definitely helps for cleaning
Easy to use
Easy to use and remove
My husband was getting very aggravated at having a clogged drain what seemed like every other week
So he asked me to buy a hair catcher for the drain
Found these for a really good price and thought "Can't hurt to try"
These catch about 90% of my hair from going down the drain
Super easy to clean off (still gross because of the soap scum and slime) but our drain hasn't been clogged since
"It does not suction at all, we just had to place it over the drain and it pretty much stays put"
The previous drain covers I've used always get a bit messy and hairs get tangled up and difficult to remove
These are much easier to clean and still catch all the hair
Great price for a pack of 5
Love the different colors too
Everyone in my house has long hair so this product easily catches our hair and avoids clogs
We put one in every bathtub and also in the kitchen to catch any food scraps
This product is very easy to install and remove to clean
Work well simple to use
Great idea
Very easy to install and so excited I won't have to unclog my drain once a month
"i was looking for something like this for a long time ,, not fancy ,, just serves the purpose they are perfect ,, would order again"
I needed something to catch the hairs so it doesn't get stuck in my drain
This is perfect
Love the material - it's quality
Also love the colors they came in - fits perfectly on the shower drain in almost all my bathrooms in the house :) recommend
I order this because we were having constantly issues with cloged sink and tub with hair
"i was pleasanly suprised when i got it and i saw 5 of those cute circles with nice diferent colors:) it stays at the sink as u will live it , does not move around and catches all hair"
also i put one in my kitchen sink so catch all small foods disposal
this is very usable product and its deff worth buying it
i recomend it to everybody
This hair catcher is amazing and I love the look of it
I would definitely recommend this produce to my friends and family
Great Product
I've been using these for awhile now and they work great for the drain in the shower and the drain in the kitchen
They stop the hair from going down the drain and are easy to clean
"However, they do sometimes get moldy if left if the shower too long after being wet, but I washed them with a little bleach and they were good to go"
"Overall, I am happy with the product"
I am currently dependent upon a shower shower after a bad accident
I lose a ton of hair and cleaning out the drain was too hard for me
Then someone told me about these and it changed everything
It was a lot easier for me to grab these to clean the drain after
Great purchase
Best quality
I like easy it is to use and it comes with a variety of colors
These work great
And its easy to get my hair
They dont move even if you step on them in the shower
I love them and love the colors
Est'n bien pero yo pens'  que se pegaban  ala ducha o x lugar
Pero no ellas
Quedan hay puestas  ceria bueno
"Does the job, and if you have a bunch of friends who need these things, you're all set"
Clogged drains in shower and sink gone away
The design is ideal for flat surfaces and drain openings
If the drain has any protruding part to it like the drain stopper these do not seal around the base of your tub or sink and the hair will go right down the drain bypassing the catcher all together
The product itself is good quality and the colors are pleasant
If I had a flat drain I think these would work very well
These do not work
I just had to take my tr as p apart to pull out the long hair that it did not catch
Does not stay in place either
Disappointed & now I am out of the return window
I bought this for my shower cause my hair kept clogging the drain and it has been working fine
The size is big enough to fit any drain be it kitchen sink or bathroom sink and if one of them gets dirty or breaks you will always have an additional one for back up
Its super easy to install and remove too
I bought this to replace my pop-up drain plug
It definitely catches hair but I wish it stuck to the sink better
My bathroom always gets clogged up because of my excessive hair fall
I bought this product and tested it and the result is great
All of my hair gets trapped and does not clog up my bathroom drain
Recommend it 5/5
I bought these to use in the bathtub to catch wallop the hair but they don't stay on the drain
Slide off as soon as the water firms on
No suction at all
"This caught all the hair, easy to clean"
soap suds build easily so remove the hair daily
"Works great, keeps hair/debris out of drain pipe"
No more clogs
works as directed to catch most (some
) hair before it blocks the drain
Absolutely love these
Cheap but great and durable product
Also it comes in such cute colors
Fits over any drain really I was really surprised
That's very good
I should bought it earlier
Not much suction but does the job for my long hair
Doesn't stay in place so defeats the purpose
This product does wonders
I have curly hair so hair getting stuck in my shower drain is always a problem but with these it has made me and my shower happy lol
Excellent product shipped so fast
"I have long hair and my hair is falling out a lot because I had a baby, and this product has been very useful"
Does exactly what I expected and bought it for
You won't waste your money on it when you buy it if you buy it for your drains
Do not waste your money on this
It does nothing but float above the drain and hair just flows under it directly into your drain
It doesn't work at all
Horrible purchase
"great, it fits perfectly"
Catch most of the hair
"I use it to catch my thick wavy hair in the shower, easy to clean out and it just sits over the drain , great value with a great price"
"Looks good, easy to install, seems durable"
Other reviewers spoke very highly of this hair catcher
Maybe I'm not using it correctly
"I placed it over the drain but when I turn in the water, the hair catcher lifts up and flats away"
There is no way to suction it down
It does catch hair but it doesn't stay in place
I'm not sure how I feel about it
The suction not strong enough
Its a very well made product
I use these in my bathroom tub and sinks
It works as described
"I like the multi color option, it adds style"
They ate pretty but useless
They don't catch hair AT ALL
It all goes through the holes
I always have the shower drain problem
I brought it and put it on my tub
"It catch all the hair from the shower, but the water run slower"
We need to clean the hair after the shower
It make me no headache
No more clog
Thank
Product is well made and fixed problem I had with an old drain cover
Easy to install and keep clean
This is a great product
Good value for money
It certainly does what it says on the box
Great product for a great price
I would highly recommend this
I liked the ease of cleaning
but we were sad that it was not effective at catching long fine hair strands
I put two of these in the kitchen sinks and one in my shower
I've been needing to purchase some kind of drain protector thingy and this is PERFECT
The colors are really nice too :D
Unfortunately this didn't work for me
The drainer floats and my hair seems to falls through the the holes
"Would've given 5 stars, but it doesn't strain fine enough"
Don't waste your money for this
I loved the colors and size of these hair catchers
The silicone sticks easily to the tub and covers the whole drain
Easy to rinse hair off of it too
"Color and texture are amazing, but the hole is almost the same size as our bathtub, don't know whether it can catch any hair or not"
Came as advertised
No more clogged drains
I really liked this product very easy to use and clean
It fulfilled my purpose
So far it's been working well
"My roommate and I bought it so it can catch our hair and it does exactly that, so I have no complaints with that"
"I do wish that suctions better to the drain and doesn't move when you first turn on the water, but at least when you turn the shower on it doesn't move"
"It also slowly drains the water, but it doesn't flood the tub at all"
Don't buy when doesn't work
The water when turned on it floats away
What a great deal
we are using 2 in each bathroom so you can just replace one while cleaning the other
"Super easy to use, came immediately"
So excited to try this product
"Living in an apartment, I am always so grossed out by the drains people have used before me"
Excited to not add to the grossness :)
Just an FYI I ordered these only to find they may be good for a flat drain but I need the type that can be used with a "pop up" drain plug in the tub
so they were useless for my use and I returned them
If your drains is a flat surface or concaved the may work but they are flat
"I have a raised stopper in tub, I didn't fit"
Perfect for my needs
Comes with enough extra that I can swap them out for cleaning
Very happy with this purchase
"Needed something to cover my drains for both hair, food, and as a New Yorker, prevent cock roaches from coming out of my drains if it were to ever come to that"
"This is perfect for my needs and the colors are just right - not too bright, muted and pastel"
"Kinda slides off the drain in the tub, gotta readjust it during shower"
this product catches the hair for sure
"however, i've found it slips around and does not always stay on top of the drain"
These are super easy to use and clean
I bought them for my trail trailer
The bathroom sink did not have a hair catcher
This works great
very useful product to catch hair in bathroom
"Great product, serves its purpose well"
Also really like the colors
Absolutely perfect
I can't believe how much hair it caught
I have a very fury dog that refuses to stay out of the pool in the summer
"So after she takes a dip,  I need to rinse her off in the house"
It has become necessary to call the plumber several times a year just to keep the tub from clogging
This product should save me time and money
Thank you
The holes are not big enough so it's more like a water stopped than hair blocker
"easy to use, nice material"
"Its doing what is needed and stopping the  hairs flowing into the sewer, which is very important so that it does not clog and create  handyman's job"
"I am really happy with the way its working and its so easy to clean, what more is needed, thank you for keeping clean and saving some $"
Gets the job done and I'm happy with my purchase
Works great and such cute colors
Works great
Easy to use and keeps my hair from clogging the drain
Love this product
Had issues with a steel hair catcher for drain in shower and it was gross
This is perfect
I have ordered other drain stoppers but this one in particular has been the best because it stays above the opening which prevents the drain from backing up
I am looking forward to washing my hair and having an easy clean up process
"These are a lot bigger than I was anticipating, but they work great"
Very easy installation and works like a charm
"I always had issues with my waist length hair clogging up my sink and my drain, but but after buying and placing two of these, my drains cleared like a charm"
And it's a great price for so many
Would definitely recommend this
"Some strands can get under the edge, but they're long enough that the little nubs around the perimeter have caught them"
I don't have to worry about cleaning hair from the shower drain now
"We use these in the bathtub and the bathroom sinks and they work to catch most of the hair; however, if they suctioned to the tub surface instead of occasionally sliding around, they would catch all of the hair"
Can't wait to save time removing hair from the shower drain
Here is to not having to stand in water while taking a shower
Colors could have been brighter
Seems to work well
easy to suction to shower floor
"This product actually catches hair, and it's super easy to clean"
"I like that it comes in a multi pack for either multiple sinks in the house, or for when it's just time to replace the one you're using"
Love the product
Great price and works great
"Great product, perfect size"
Easy to clean
stays in place
works great
collects hair
easy to remove and discard hair after
thankful to now save my shower drain
Super cute colors
Fits perfectly over my shower drain
"I can't speak to its suction power or how well it catches hair at this time, but I'm already satisfied with the product"
"Such a great deal, too"
I love the color and works perfectly in my shower
Easy to clean/remove/ and reuse
Originally got it for my shower but use one in the kitchen sink as well
Fast/great service
Product is good quality and easy to use
Good price as well
The material is strong and it is exactly what I was looking for to keep hair out of the pipes
It's a good value for the money too
perfect for what i needed and i like the colors
Great product overall
I always had issues with my long hair clogging my shower and sink drain in my apartment
These work well to catch the hair before it goes down the drain
I got a pack of 5 which was for a really good deal
I love the colors they come in
A little tricky to clean/get the hair off but they do the trick and they're cheap enough to buy again and again if you just want to toss them after using for a few months
"I have really thick curly hair that really clogs drains, ive been looking for a way to capture it all without ruining the plumbing"
These are amazing
"I have one in both my boyfriends bathrooms, and gave one to my step mom for her house, she has really long hair"
We love them
Stops so much hair from going down
Once water hits the hair catcher it sucks to the floor so it's not so easy to move
Great price for multiple products
Can use in all the drains in my house
The colors are all very nice as well
I am very happy with my purchase and I have them in all of our bathrooms
This allows you to catch the hair before it goes down the drain and still let's the water through
Product is so awesome and worth it
I love how durable they feel and all the colors it comes with
"Great product, easy to install and remove for cleaning"
Catches hair and stops things from clogging the drain
Complete waste of money
I bought these specifically for my kitchen sinks but also planned on using in the bathtub/shower
They do not stay in place and easily move around and off of the holes
The holes are also too big so everything just passes through them
Definitely look elsewhere
The plug in my daughter's bathtub broke so this was an easy fix to cover the opening and with 2 girls using the tub it was a bonus to catch hair that would normally go down the drain
Great hair catcher
Price is fair
5 pieces of hair catcher only cost 10$
It ready keeps the hair out of the shower drain
"I had high hopes for this, but I don't feel it is catching all of my hair"
Seems like a great product great value for the price
Good quality and great colors
This product works well
"Hair catchers do not suction and are awkwardly large for any sink, but the size works well for my bath"
Traps my hair curly hair well
"**I took a customer survey because the seller promised that I would get a $10 amazon gift card for doing so, and still no gift card or response from the seller"
I still want my gift card
Works exactly how described
Great price for the amount of product
My mother loved them
They're neutral colors and serve their purpose
Stuck to the sink drain just fine
Does the job
"Now if I can keep the dogs out of the bathroom so they won't steal it, all will be well"
I need a hair catcher on a flat surface
This is exactly what I want
Product is colorful also
Sometimes it floats away but it works 90% of the time
Stays on drain and easier to clean than I anticipated
Hopefully it will keep me from having to clean out the shower drain constantly with chemicals cleaners
I used them in two stand up showers
Product gets moldy and does not stay in place
The product doesn't suction at all in my tub
Still works great and catches hair no problem
The item is A LOT bigger than I thought
I doubt it while first received it
But I have to admit it's very useful
It's easy removable
"The default is when you pour lot of water on it, it might move"
"But it worlds so well for my kitchen drain and bathtub, catching my hairs and kitchen garbage"
Great
Great filter that just drops on top of the drain and cleans easily
Only negative is it slides around a little bit if bumped
Love all of the colors
Lots of colors to choose from
Works great
Does not catch any hair
This met my expectations for a drain cover
These work great
I love that there are 5 to a pack and I can just toss the used one
Fit perfectly over my drain and now I don't have additional stress about the hair I am losing after having a baby
I know my husband sure appreciates the purchase
I would recommend for anyone trying to avoid hair clogs
This product is so great for catching all my hair
I love it
It works well and stops my hair from going down the drain
Worth the price
Been two days since installation which was pretty easy
So far all good
"works well, easy to clean"
All you need to do is lie it over drain
Easy to dispose hair
Even catches short hair
This product has no suction cup to stick to the bathtub or sink
It moves easily
Waste of $
Love the colors and works perfectly
Good hairstopper for the bathtub
Exact product that I was looking for
Received enough spare
Using it in our sink and shower
Works great
Love the colors
"Nice feel, sits well on drain and catches hair well"
They do just as advertised
"I use them to keep my hard contacts from going down the drain, again"
Nice to have multi pack so I can take them when I travel
This product works great in my shower
I have 3 daughters with long hair and this works wonders
Nice bright colors
"Was straightforward enough to 'install', grips on bottom keep it from moving around, and it catches hair like it's supposed to"
"Although these are reusable, the pack comes with enough to last you a year if you do need to replace or need them for multiple drains"
catches all the hair
"I love how well they keep hair out of your drains, and still let's water out, instead of stopping it from going down,"
You need this if you worry about hair blocking your sink
Complete waste of money
Doesn't work at all
"Floats off the drain rather than catching hair, etc"
Great convenience to have multiple ones to have on hand for future replacement
Good value
works as it should
Doesn't stay at place
Not worth your money
"I put this in my shower with this hair catcher the water can't drain easily, it's constantly moving around and the hair just slipped beneath it"
Don't waste your money
I shed a lot of hair and this catches everything
Fits perfectly over my drain as well
Best way to avoid snaking your drain
I love that it's a five pack so when you're ready to toss it you're good to go
"Great product, will buy again"
Great product it is very functional and doesn't slide around
"I thought this item would catch the hair in the bathtub shower, but I was wrong"
It is too flat to fit anywhere but in the kitchen sink (where I don't really need it)
Wasted purchase
"Buy only if you intend to install it where there is no drain mechanism, as it can only fit on a flat (and rather large) surface"
Finally no more clogged shower drains
This product works great
Stays put and catches all the hair
I love this product
Works great
Very easy to install
A little big for my kitchen sink so I'll give some of the extras to other family members instead
This is not catching any hair at all in my bathtub drain
It is effectively useless
Not sure how this ended up an Amazon choice or best selling product
Easy to use
Love it
"It is easy to cut to size, we had to cut a few layers off to perfectly fit our drain"
It does not hurt when you step on it which is nice
"Product is light weight and kind of floats when there is a lot of water which allows hair to slide underneath sometimes, a metal one doesn't do that"
This works for many size drains
Mine is a normal (smaller-sized) drain and this product does the trick
"It catches long hairs which I clean off with a tissue or toilet paper, easy clean up"
Great product for the price
Very happy so far
"Very cute, lays flat and does the job"
Does not catch food bits
I bought this for myself and my aunts
"I received it promptly, and it's exactly as described"
It prevents hair of all lengths from going down the shower drain
"I highly recommend this product, and I will purchase from this seller again"
"Good size, seems like they will stay put"
Have not used in the shower yet but the material seems durable
Returned
No suction and floated away from the drain in the shower
Didn't prevent and hair from going down the drain
was also too large
"I could see using in a kitchen sink as a cover to peel carrots or potatoes, but who needs 6 for that"
Very cute and useful
This is perfect for a household of people with super long hair
Our tub was clogging every couple of weeks but once we put this Hair Catcher Stopper in the tub we haven't had to deal with clogs anymore
We also added one to our bathroom sink which of course not only catches hair but also keeps jewelry from going down the drain
This product covers the entire drain very well because of the size and makes keeping the drains clean super convenient
There is no suctioning power
It is literally a mat that lays on top of your drain
"Once you run the water, the mat floats from the top of the drain"
No suctioning power at all
It cost me $10 but it's definitely getting returned
"These are attractive, practical and made out of silicone so no rusting"
And the assorted colors are a bonus
"We are using it in our stall shower with a new bathmat as well (shown here) from Amazon:Vive Shower Mat - 22"" by 22"" Square Non Slip Large Bath Mat for Bathtub - Suction Cup Traction Skid Pad for Stalls, Floors, Tub - Textured Rubber with Drain Hole - for Kids, Baby, Elderly, Adults"
"Great and simple to use, works as expected"
It catches hair
Very simple to just put over the drain
I love that it is silicon so that it can be easily cleaned
Works so well
Catches my hair and so easy to take off
Great for catching hair
And a lot came
Pretty color
My friend introduce me to use this in my salon since we has to call plumer so often
This hair catcher is very good since it filter from the side to middle
So easy to clean
Great product
Great product
It didn't move around whether someone was taking a shower or a bath
It was really easy to install as well
no more hair clogged in sink drain
I love this product and it works so well
100% recommend
Like the colors and really catches the hair
I love these for the shower
I've purchased couple hair catcher before and none of them works
This hair catcher surprised me and does exactly what it's supposed to do
"Yes, after a while it doesn't drain as well during your hair washing but simple solution: remove the hair from the hair catcher then proceed to finish washing your hair"
"Sits in the tub, blocks things from going down"
Pretty much get what you pay for
"Five filter net, different colors, good quality, size or large, shortcomings are easily washed away, not easy to fix, silicon material"
Works great
Works so well in our tub with a drain that is flush with tub
"Lies flat, catches hair so well"
"Easy to use and clean, very effective to catch hair in the sink"
My purchase is a bit bigger than I thought they'd be but still work fairly well
Was very easy to install and it feels and looks very durable
I installed it right away in the bathrooms and the kitchen
I was able to wash my very thick curly hair without having any hair go down the drain so i call that a win
Keeps from my hair doing down the drain
Love these
So easy to use  and clean up
Perfect for catching hair before it gets stuck in the drain
This is a great size
I like the larger diameter
My only suggestion would be to make the middle more of an indented cup
that way it's snugly fits in the tub
"As of now, The way it is made with water pressure it does move away from the drain as you are taking a shower or bathing"
It doesn't stick/work on my bathtubs
Disappointed
I have used them for 3+ weeks
I have not noticed any hair caught in them
I have 4 girls with very thick long hair
There should be a lot of hair in these stoppers
I don't think they are working at all
Very Disappointed
Perfect
This product is true to the pictures and product description
I received all five of the hair catchers in perfect shape and they all appeared true to their colors in the picture
The hair stoppers work great
Whenever one gets clogged up I'll just throw it out and replace it
My shower/bath drain gets clogged with hair way too easily and this is the best solution that I have tried so far
My boyfriend has never been happier
Works great and such a affordable price
This drain cover works as well as other leading brand product
"However, it only costs a fraction of the cost"
Does not get moldy as easily
Nitbfor kitchen  use I did not find any suction power at all
Put one in my kitchen sink did not stay in place it easy moved around did not stay in place when emptying out it just fell all just folded all over the place very flimsy
Worked okay in my standing shower
not so much in the kids tub
"These drain stoppers seemed large when I took them out of the package, but over the drain it covers the whole piece so that nothing slips through"
It doesn't suction into place or is held down by anything so you just have to make sure it's set where you want it
It looks like it'll be great in my kitchen sink and shower
Great colors
The colors are so cute and it catches every hair
Totally wasting money
It does not stick with tub/sink at all
Love this product
Especially that it comes with 5
"Easy to use, clean and actually drains the water and catches the hair"
Good price but not much suction
There is so suction power at all
Constantly moves our of place defeating the whole purpose
"Product works well, mostly good for a flat drain though"
If you have a bathtub drain you might have to take it out for it for this to collect hair
Great Product
These work great
They stick to the bathtub and don't slide around
They're easy to pop up and clean out
I've tried other products but it was so hard to clean out the hair
These are easy and economical
"We liked the color choices, nice design"
"We did have to remove the drain plug for it to fit  over the shower drain, but it stays in place well"
The 5 pack is also convenient so all the drain covers in the home can be similar
Would by again
Works great
Exactly what I was looking for
I used this Product to stop my Wife and Daughter from clogging both our Shower and Laundry Tub everytime they wash their Hair
It's a WONDERFUL thing to have in Our House
Honestly I don't understand what these things are supposed to even do
"I *thought* they were meant to cover a tub/shower drain and catch hair, so I bought them for that purpose to keep my drains clear when bathing my dogs"
"However, as soon as I turn the tub on these things just literally float away and do absolutely nothing"
Are they supposed to have suction cups on the bottom or something
I am baffled
They do literally nothing
these little things keep all the hair from going down into your shower drain
They go on easy and clean well
"There are five colors in it, which are cute"
"But it doesn't work at all, it can't fit the bath sink at all"
And it is completely free to move
It can't grab my hair every time I wash my hair
"I bought this product just wants it to catch my hair, otherwise the sink will be blocked"
I bought this product based on the reviews
I was disappointed
"The hair catcher did not suction well to the drain, and the hair would slide under it and go down the drain"
It was hard to remove the hair that did get caught on it
"Half of the hair would be hanging down the drain, pretty gross when pulled up"
Product works as described
"I bought it for my friend, she likes it a lot, but complained that it slips sometimes"
"other then that, pretty good"
Easy to useEasy to cleanEasy and low price to replace
This worked great for my shower tub
Love that it comes with multiple
I loved the idea of this shower drain cover
"It didn't work for me, but that may be because I have a fiberglass tub/shower unit"
The fiberglass isn't smooth
Perhaps if I had a smooth surface the drain cover would have worked better
"Also, I started using it when the drain was already just a bit plugged"
That meant there was almost always at least a thin layer of water
The drain cover floated around in the water
"I never caught a single piece of hair in the weeks that I used this drain cover, yet I know both I and my husband shed hair with every shower"
Great product put it in my tub as soon as I got it and it trapped the hair great easy to clean also
I like the colors
They move too easily
Time will tell on the usefulness
Nice color options
Easy to install and great product
Great product
Works great
Only thing is it cause a bit of water to collect in the shower while showering
Not a big deal though and not a defect of the product
It sits over the drain very nicely
Does a great job catching hair
I bought this for my bathroom sink
It was very easy to install and works great
"Great product, worked exactly as was stated in the description"
Would buy again
These hair drain catchers are great
After trying several other kinds and being disappointed I tried these thinking they probably wouldn't work either
Wow was I ever wrong
They catch the hair so well
To clean the hair off I flip it over to the non bumpy side and the hair comes off so easily with my fingers
I found it's easiest to clean it every time
No more clogged drains with these
Try them you will be glad you did
It didnt work
Hair went through it so easily and the shower clogged again within a week
Buy something else
Amazing product love the colors
Catches hair  very well
Definitely recommend
Works great for its intended purpose
They didnt catch any hair
They went right in the trash
It was nice to have several options with colors and it was easy to place above the drain
The fit was not the perfect for my drain but it fully covered the drain
"It contains some hair, although some goes through it"
It does its job
Just got it but i love the colors and it was easy to install
Can't wait to see how great it works
This is a great product to avoid the drain getting stopped up from hair
You will save money from hiring a plumber to unclog your drains
This was too big and didn't fit my shower drain
"The bottom has spikes that makes the flat part sit up so even though it is larger than the drain hole, it sits up too high"
"I cut around the edge to make it fit inside the shower drain hole but after a week, there was no hair caught in it"
A waste of money in my opinion
Shower drains- works just fine so far
I will update the review on the suction power after several usage :)
Good material
Wide enough to cover but I wish its suction could be a bit better but overall a good product
I am using these to keep cucumbers which I will ferment to make pickles below the salt-water level
These are a nice size -- I can cut them to fit the top of the jars I use
"I use in the shower and bathroom sink, love how it catches the stray hairs"
"This is a great concept, but the product doesn't stick to any surface"
I use mine in the shower and the hair goes around the 'plug' because it wont stick
The slots are also rather larger and don't contain the hair once it is on the contraption
"It collects/traps hair well, but with lot of water pouring/draining through, it doesn't stay in place and lift up"
I have a stall shower and my hair is medium length and thickness
I've been using this product for about a week and have noticed that it has caught a good amount of hair in just a few hair washes
"Because my shower is a flat stall shower and doesn't pool the water, I've noticed that the water does not go down as quickly as it did before I had this drain cover, but that doesn't bother me at all"
Good quality and easy to install
Not sure about the suction power but it works and I love how it's flat and can fit any drain
Cute colors too
"Something that I didn't realize that I needed, my son's thick head of hair resulted in the shedding and clogging our pipes"
This hair catcher is so simple and works well
"Fit differs per drain, but works well regardless"
This hair catcher works exactly as planned
"With a household of three females, it is essential to have one of these as our hair can easily clog the drain"
I am so happy I have this installed
The thing I like the most about the drain covers is that they work perfectly on all of my drains no matter what the size they are
"They are 5 inches round and not only does it trap hair but it catches food debris and anything else that happens to fall into my kitchen, bathroom sinks or bathtub"
"God bless her soul my 83 year-old mother who when she colors her hair some of it falls out because she's 83 years old and I'm constantly going to her home and unclogging the drain and her bathroom, so I purchased these because they come in a pack of 5 I only needed 3, I had two left over I gave my Mom the two I did not need and it will save me hundreds of dollars in plumbing service calls"
They're made of a combination plastic/rubber soft & thin & flexible non-skid material which is another reason why I like them
The center holes are perfectly space and catches smaller debris and the bigger slots catch the bigger debris like hair and food
The primary reason I purchased them is because I got tired of calling the plumber when I couldn't get to my mom's house to unclog her bathroom sink drain
You can't beat the price it's worth its weight in gold
Who knew that such a simple product would give me peace of mind and MONEY
Great product
Love this product
"I'm always loosing my hair in the shower, so this made easy clean"
I use use one in my kitchen and very convenient because I don't like using my garbage drain
"it comes with 5 unit and it is good at catching long har & small objects, better pipes and help you not clog in the future"
We bought these after our plumber said that the standard drain shrooms aren't very effective
These have worked great
They stay in place and are very effective
Just as expected
Amazing product and it catches all your hair
Super Easy to Use
Would recommend
This product is definitely worth the low cost
"If you are trying to prevent hair from entering your drains, this product will satisfy your needs"
Lays right against the bottom of the tub and is really easy to clean
I wish it suctioned to the tub but still a great buy
Nice
It's 5 colors and make the bathroom cute
"easy to clean, too"
Nice soft flexible material
Economically priced
Pretty colors
Useful with different drains
"Perfect idea, works great in my shower"
Gave a few away to family
Thanks for such a great product
Slips off of drain easily as water is running from spout
Worked much better once shower head was turned on
I bought this to use in kitchen and bathroom sinks as the description suggests
Box makes no mention of kitchen use and food particles slip right through catch and down the drain
This is ok for hair in the shower and not for the kitchen sink
I have been looking for a product like this for a long time
No more clogs
Did not do a good job of catching
Almost all went through
Easy to use
Easy to place down easy to clean
just ordered them and they came fast
guess we'll see how they stand up
seems good so far
These are great and big enough for tub/sink
They move around and do not stay in place to catch hair
Bought these at the request of my parents and they love them
Easy to clean and the colors are great
They do not stay in place and are impossible to rinse the food from between the ridges
Stops hair from clogging drain
Easy to cleAn
Perfect if you're sick of your girlfriends hair clogging the drains
It moved evertime it came in contact with water
Liked the quantity
"So far, so good"
"I did notice once it seemed to get stopped up with soap, and couldn't push water through anymore"
Hopefully that's just an anomaly though
It hasn't happened again
This worked great
Easy to install and I love the colors
"I have long hair that sheds all the time, this is definitely a cheap and easy solution to the problem"
Lays flat over the drain in the walk in shower
Perfect
Exactly what we were looking for
The colors are great
Would highly recommend if you need a flat drain cover
I wish I found these along time ago
We have a septic and would of saved some arguments over how much of my hair I loose down the shower drain
"These work great, soft on the feet and the colors are nice"
I put one in my shower and one in my bathroom sink
I'm going to send a couple next door for my nieces to try out
Absolutely amazing product
Perfect solution to mine and my daughter's shedding hair problem
I'm over the moon I found it
"And so far, my favorite"
We tried one that looks like a mushroom and it was hard to clean and always had mildew growing on it
We had one that had little suction cups on the bottom of it
But that just left little gaps for the hair to get through
"These however, have no suction cups and is really easy to clean"
"At first, I thought, these aren't going to work"
They're going to just slide around
But they don't
They stay put really well
And they do catch hair
All the hair
Even manscape hair
;o)  I'm pretty impressed
"Though it did slide a bit right after the installation, it hasn't slid around in the showers I've taken since the first installation"
Bigger than I expected but it's a great size for good catch coverage
works well
I purchased this to help catch hair in the shower
"it doesnt hold the best suction onto the floor, yet still causes water to pool"
the shower water is unable to drain as easily because it has to rise over the several millimeter thickness of the product
"because of the water pooling, I ended up returning the item"
Great product
Catches hair really well
Great deal as it includes 5 traps to use
I use this in my shower and it covers the hole perfectly and catches so much
I Jane long hair and even if some gets through it catches at the bottom and pulls it back up
Saving me from clogged drains
I've tried several products to trap hair in my bathtub and this is BY FAR the best
Soap residue easily washes away leaving hair clinging to the trap
It's super easy to pull the hair off of the trap every week or so and drop it back into the tub for another use
"Nothing icky, slimy or oder collecting :)"
Works as described and should help keep the drains from being clogged up
"Someone mentioned that this wouldn't work in sinks with drain plugs that stick up, but it's working great for me"
This has been great so far for catching my hair
Cute light color selection
Easy to clean when there is debris that has been caught
It does not stick to the tile floor and hair just goes underneath instead of catching hair
It prevents hair from flowing into the sewer and is easy to use
It's easy to install and remove to clean
It's a good deal
Easy to clean and maintain
Easy to use and works great
I use it primarily for when I wash hair in my kitchen sink
this catches ALL the hair and lets none go down the drain
When I'm done using it I set it on a paper towel and let it dry and then any hair caught comes right out and into the trash
"Good product, but it doesn't suction onto the tub"
Will give a shot over the next few weeks to see how it does
"Arrived on time, super easy to install"
Love that it came in a 5 pack because I have multiple showers in my house and I could even give some to my mom to use at her house :)
"Nothing to dislike, works well"
This works great for my shower
Have had difficulty finding one that works for me and this definitely fit the bill
"I really wanted these to work and they do catch some hair, but a lot of the hair ends up on the side of the drain and I end up placing it in"
It stays in place but the sides aren't as flushed to the tub as I would have liked and for it to catch hair
Fortunately my drain has a little lip in it that these fit nicely into so it stays relatively well and catches the hair
"Otherwise, there's not much suction on these"
Okay for the price
The goods arrive quickly and the packaging is beautiful and intact
It's bigger than expected and has strong adsorption
Very effective for cleaning hair residues
I really like this hair catcher
I was looking for something a bit prettier than a normal metal one and this was it
Works great to catch the hair and just lays right on top of the drain
Easy and comes with so many colors
Happy to be able to switch them out as we want
This product is awesome
Just little trouble getting hair out if they are oily
But overall good product
"Easy to install and works like a charm, catches the hairs before any real damage is done to the drain"
a must have
"We bought primarily for the kids shower/tub, because we have a 12 yr old girl with LONG hair, it works great"
"For our master bath stall shower, it works but is kinda ""in the way"" and if you're not careful you'll ""kick"" it off the drain"
"I am going with, I would recommend"
Large enough to cover my large shower drain
No installation just lay over drain
I wanted to like this product but unfortunately it doesn't suction at all
"IF it suctioned even a little I wouldn't complain, but it doesn't suction at all"
Doesn't stay in place and hair still goes threw
I appreciated the idea but not a product I would purchase again
"It's very good, I've used it a few times and each time it has collected and stopped my long hair from going down the drain"
Getting the hair out is a little tricky
But overall did exactly what I needed
To prevent hair going down the drain
Easy to use
Easy to remove
"My drain doesn't have any kind of plug, so these were perfect"
Es super f'cil de usar
no peligroso
f'cil de limpiar
lo recomiendo al 100%
This is great for catching hair in the tub
"When it's dry, the hair catcher moves around from the water, but stays in place once it gets wet"
It does let some long hair through (thus I subtracted 1 star) but generally catches most hair that would get stuck in the drain
Good purchase
Love this product
Is it super easy to use and to clean
I'm always having to use Draino in my drains because of my hair
"However, this product stops my hair from getting inside and therefore, from getting my drain clogged"
Would definitely recommend this to people :)
Arrived next day
Pretty colors
"Bigger than expected, but does it's job"
Can't complain
Product worked great
My husband was skeptical that it would let the water drain in the travel trailer showerr but there was no problem
The shower still drained completely with no standing water as it did not block the drain at all
Best of all it caught all my hair before it got into the drain and could get gross and problematic
Awesone
Value product that works great
This product has worked great for me and so far have loved it
Would recommend for anyone who wants a cheap and working shower hair plug
We had to call our plumber multiple times last month to fix the clogged bathtub
Not any more
This hair catcher is a life saver
"Ever since we bought it, we don't have the clogging issue and it's also very convenient to clean"
The hair catchers are nice colors and look better than the photos
Best thing ever for my shower
This has saved me more times than I can think and works better than the standard hair catcher
It's easy to clean and put back in
Doesnt stick to tub
Keeps moving when water falls
I have very long hair that always gets trapped in the drain and my shower grate and it's super frustrating to try and clean and unclog the drain
"This works perfectly and comes in a 5 pack, which is super convenient"
Fast Shipping and quality product
"We have tried many hair catchers in the past, and this one is the best one yet"
It fits nicely over the drain in our shower and looks wonderful
Would recommend
It was super easy to put in the shower and works great
"Easy to clean, comes in different colors and can easily move it around in the shower"
"Cleaning the drain every time after shower is a lot of work, so I bought this hair catcher"
Item works as expected (can help catch the hair so well)
The drain hair catcher is very easy to install without any tool
It is made of plastic material so it fit most of the drains
The price is reasonable
They look cute with 5 pretty colors
They are easy to bend and will not hurt when you step on it
But it is a bit easy to be pushed around
water can be drained fast
Needed something to keep drain from clogging with my hair after washing it
"I love this, doesn't slip and I they send 5 love it"
Easy to install
Gets the job done
Love the variety of colors
It does not catch all the hair because it does not suction in well
It is better than nothing but wish it worked better
Super
"good product, value for this price"
"Does not stay in place,"
I like that I dont need to stuff this in pipe area anymore
Just lay this on top
Work nicely
Easy to use
"Easy to use product, beautiful color selection"
Satisfied for the price I paid
"They were much bigger than I anticipated, so I couldn't use them for my bathroom sink,  like I bought them for"
I ended up putting them in my kitchen sink to prevent food getting down the drain
"It didn't work for my bathroom,  but at least it worked  for the kitchen"
I usually have such a tough time finding a hair catcher for my drain in the bathroom because it's an old school tub
This hair catcher is perfect and will definitely purchase again when I run out
Great product
"They were bigger than expected, which is great, covers the drain perfect"
Easy to install and remove
Works really well none of my hair got through and it still managed to keep the regular flow of water going down the drain
"Gets the job done, although I do wish it had suction to stay place it typically only moves when the water is coming out the faucet not the shower"
But it does collect hair a good amount there are some that get through the middle part
Overall I'm happy with purchase
Much much much needed hair catcher
"Quarantine hair is getting long, and this is a phenomenal solution for a new apartment"
I wish I had this from the day I moved in
I am very excited to try this product as I have long hair
The packaging was great
Satisfied
Just moved into our new home and our shower tub was missing the shower drain protector
This has been working great
Alot of my hair falls out in the shower and its essential to keep my hair from going to clog up our drains
At the end of my shower it super easy to remove and clean for the next time
Great product
Works wonderful and SO easy to use
So far so good
Catches my long hair
Does what it's meant to do
"Installs easily and  captures all my hair, making it easy to dispose of in the trash"
I would recommend this product
Very good shower strainer/ bathtub strainer
Got all the hair in the shower and easy to clean
"Although this product is cheap, I think it has no effect"
"After using it for a while, it became dirty and difficult to clean"
The product is exactly as described and arrived early
I like the color options and they seem very durable
Gave my puppy a bath and it got like 98% of her short little hair
Only thing is it doesn't stay in place if the faucet is running
But that could be the amount of water pressure coming out
"The colors are super relaxed too I expected more brights, but these are more matte and chill I'm so excited to try using it when i wash my hair it's about 2 feet long so that will be the big test"
"Works super well, you just plop it down and done"
The colors are really cute too
These are great
They're so much easier to clean than standard drain stoppers
Would definitely recommend to anyone who's tired of picking hair out of a metal drain stopper that never really feels clean
Seems like it works as advertised
"I thought, at first glance, they may be too big but I think they look fine in the"
"For cleanliness, FIVE STARS"
I've tried them all and this one is the best by far
The silicon is easy to clean and it doesn't get scummy or gross like some of the competitors
"For looks, I don't think it would look great in a shower with glass doors or one where you can see it all the time"
"Overall, would reccommend"
Practical product to use in a cubicle shower
I did that and the cover stayed well in place
"The holes are big enough for water to flow easily, yet small enough to catch hair that I seem to shed a lot now that I have delivered my baby"
I tried the other products in the tub drain but it did not have enough suction to stay place
Bathing my dog will no longer be a problem
So happy with this product
"Had to cut a hole in the middle, so it would fit"
I originally thought it would completely go over the drain
"Works okayyy in collecting hair, but honestly thought it clogged up the drain even more with it on"
And then the hair gets stuck in the little holes
Or it just washes under because the suction is not so powerful
Not very easy to clean
Guess it's expected for the price
But would choose something else
Using these in my sink
Love all the colors
It means I can switch them to match my seasonal decor
I just moved into a new house and these were my first purchase
They are an absolute must
Unlike other shower hair catchers - these don't have a pool of water that you end up standing it
It traps the hair while not blocking the water flow
Very easy to clean at the end of the shower too
Does what it's suppose to do
Good product
Super excited when this came in the mail
The pac of five meant I could try it in the kitchen and shower
So far so good
It does a much better job catching food than the typical metal catcher and hair is easy to remove
love the colors
Very functional
Love that you can use in kitchen or bathroom
Must buy will not regret
i like the simplicity of this product and hope it helps catch my long hair from going down the drain
"It works, it has a nice design"
Works fantastic I absolutely love it
Really helps with long hair
"Works great, I literally tossed it in the bathtub over the drain and it fit, couldn't have asked for it to be easier to install"
Works for any size drain because it just lays right on top
love the quality and the price
"I ordered these for my tub, but they do not stay in place at all - they move if my son bumps them, they move if the dog bumps them, they move if the shower sprays on them the wrong way"
"I have had more hair go down the drain since I have bought these, then before"
I contacted the seller and they recommended that I put double sided tape on them if I want them to stay in place
Unbelievable
Total waste of money
Product does not do what it says - unless you want to tape it in place and who knows what else
Unbelievable
Just don't buy these lol
Excited to have a clean shower drain again
"Easy to set in place,  but just received them so time will tell if they stay in place"
"Heads up, won't fit any drain unless they're flat"
Unfortunately won't work for any of mine
I have 4 dogs that I wash in the tub and this caught so much of their hair
Very happy with my purchase
More of a hassle then other hair catchers I have used
Would not recommend or buy again
Does not catch all hair
Easy to clean and use
"I have tried multiple hair catchers and I couldn't find the right one, I would still have to end up calling the plumber to come out and unclog my drain"
So glad I came across this one it comes in a multi pack with great colors and for a good price
It is a great hair catcher
"This is a great hair stopper, wether you're a prepubescent boy, a girl with too much hair or a full grown gorilla, I'm sure it'll catch your hair and keep your drain clear"
